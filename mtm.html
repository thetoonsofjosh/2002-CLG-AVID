<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Just to make sure you know, MTM stands for the
initials of the company's co-founder, Mary Tyler Moore.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(1970-1998)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nicknames</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"The MTM Kitten", "Meow"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Over the
years, the logo has been tweaked colorwise and according to certain
shows, but here's the basic concept: An "M" flies backward from off
screen, then splits into two. In the space left between the two
letters, two "T's" come from the top and bottom of the screen and
join to form one. This completes the initials of the company, and the
"T" shrinks when a gold circle appears over it. Under the letters are
the words "ENTERPRISES INC." (or whatever MTM is calling the company
at the time) Back to the circle, it is ribbon-like and decorated with
stars and the letters "MTM" on top. Inside is an orange striped
kitten who meows once, obviously in parody of the MGM lion. </FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Trivia Note</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The cat's name was "Mimsie," though nicknames such as "Dick Turpin"
and "Dick Marino" have also been used in naming the cat.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Movie Version?</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: A still version of this logo did turn up in the
movies, notably the Orion Pictures Release of "Just Between Friends"
and possibly more. This is a still of the "Red/Blue Letters" version
of the logo, and is shrunk to a considerably small size. No music,
animation, or "meow" is present.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">TV Distribution</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: A still version of the logo was used for MTM's TV
Distribution division. It has the regular "MTM" (in </FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#808000">gold</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">), and
under that and a line are the words "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#808000">TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION GROUP</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">." The circle and picture of the kitten are much bigger,
and the kitten looks like he's smiling.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Variations</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
First here are the little differences in the logo, along with dates
in which they were used:</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">1970-71: One "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
   COLOR="#F74848">M</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" was red-orange, the
   other was </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
   COLOR="#FF0000">red</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">, and the
   "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF">T</FONT><FONT
   FACE="Arial">" was blue and formed by the merging of a light blue
   "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#33BEC6">T</FONT><FONT
   FACE="Arial">" and a </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
   COLOR="#008000">green</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> one.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">1971-78: The "M's" are both </FONT><FONT
   FACE="Arial" COLOR="#F74848">red-orange</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">,
   and the "T" light blue.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">1978-83: Company now identified as
   </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#B5B500">MTM Productions
   Inc.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">1983-91: Company identified as </FONT><FONT

   FACE="Arial">. The "M's" are now </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
   COLOR="#FF0000">red</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">1992-95, 1996-98: All letters are
   </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#808000">gold</FONT><FONT
   FACE="Arial">, the words "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
   COLOR="#797211">An International Family Entertainment
   Company</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" appear, after MTM was bought by
   the Family Channel.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">1995-96: 25th Anniversary logo; on a
   </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">white</FONT><FONT
   FACE="Arial"> background is a black "25," with a similarly colored
   MTM under that. The kitten appears in the rounded part of the
   "5."</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><A NAME="mtmvari"></A>Now, one thing that the
MTM logo was known for was that often, it would be custom made for
whatever show it appeared at the end of. This means the kitten's
appearance would sometimes be different. Here are those
variations:</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The Duck Factory: As the logo forms, a
   off-screen voice states, "Where's the cat?" Instead of meowing,
   the cat says, "Quack!"</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Graham Kerr: The kitten wears a chef's
   hat.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Hill Street Blues: The kitten would wear a
   policeman's cap. </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">The
   logo also said "An MTM Enterprises Production" instead of the
   standard message.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Lou Grant &amp; Paris: There is a still
   picture of the logo.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The Mary Tyler Moore Show: The kitten
   usually meows normally, however, on the 2nd episode, the kitten's
   meow is higher-pitched, rather shrill. On Episode 71, the meow is
   replaced by Miss Moore herself, saying "Th-th-th-that's all
   folks!", a line spoken by Mary Richards during that
   episode.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The Bob Newhart Show: The 1972 Christmas
   episode features a wreath in place of the MTM ribbon.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The New WKRP: Dubbed with Les Nesman Jr.
   exclaiming "Ooh!"</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Newhart: The kitten meows... in Bob
   Newhart's voice. On the final episode, the cat yells "QUIET!",
   (the two Darryls' first and only word)</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Remington Steele: The kitten wears a
   Sherlock Holmes deerstalker cap and meerschaum pipe. While
   meowing, the pipe drops out of its mouth and falls in front of the
   word "Productions".</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">St. Elsewhere: The kitten is wearing a
   scrub suit and a surgical mask, which is animated to look like a
   mouth is moving underneath when he meows. On the final episode, he
   is hooked on life support on a hospital bed and then dies.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The Steve Allen Show: The kitten lip-syncs
   Allen saying "Schmock!"</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">White Shadow: The cat (who is not Mimsie,
   it's a different black and white cat) is pawing at a basketball.
   Also has "An MTM Enterprises Production" and no animation in the
   letters.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Xuxa: Another dub job, instead of "meow,"
   the kitten says "ciao"</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Home Video: The kitten holds a remote
   control. After meowing, the kitten hits "rewind". The picture
   winds backwards (and loses color), and the kitten meows
   again.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
splitting, dropping, merging, and shrinking letters.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Simple animation, and the kitten's animation is a bit choppy. And
when the kitten is dressed according to the show, his clothes seem to
be pasted on or poorly animated. On the White Shadow variation, the
cat's movements are caused by looped footage.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: None
really, except in 1996 when a 5-note jingle was added. Other than
that, the end theme usually finished over it and that was it.</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Uncommon, MTM has since been dissolved into 20th Century Fox when Fox
acquired IFE, but you can still see the logos on some cable and
syndicated reruns, depending on the prints. Nick At Nite/TNN's prints
of "Newhart" and "WKRP" kept the MTM logo, but usually, shows like
"America's Funniest Home Videos," and "Remington Steele" on PAX will
have the 20th Century Fox logo instead. The 20th Television logo has
also been spotted on Rescue 911 and St. Elsewhere reruns, as well as
on Hill Street Blues (which speeds up the end credits as well in
order to plaster the 20th). So basically, the MTM logo can only be
seen on older prints of their shows.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Median, the silence, the "meow" the fading out of the music, and the
kitten coming out of nowhere might catch some people by surprise.
Other than that it's mostly a cute logo.</FONT></P>
