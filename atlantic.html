(1981-1985)<br>
<br>
<u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;AR&quot;, &quot;The Lights&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: Starting on a black background, a string of flashing
white lights forms, creating a shape with blue rays of light
extending beyond the white lights. When it looks like an A is
about to be made, the lights make a right turn to a semi-oval
part. In the same trail, the lights go back up and make a more
accurate R. When the shape completes, it flashes as a a whole,
then the shape straightens out into a horizontal line. The line
flashes and all the lights split to the top &amp; bottom of the
screen. This reveals the text:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">ATLANTIC
RELEASING CORPORATION<br>
PRESENTS</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The forming of the
&quot;AR&quot; shape, which looks pretty good, but....<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The text shown at the end really, really
looks awful. It's something about the glow or font, but it really
looks dated.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: None<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: I would guess uncommon, it seems to be kept
well on most releases, but their most famous release, &quot;Teen
Wolf&quot; conflicts a bit. The print shown by TBS/TNT has this
logo, but when spotted on a tape off HBO, it had the 2nd logo. (Another
note, the TBS/TNT print ends, yes ends, with an animated
Paramount (CGI) logo of the Paramount Communications era, WEIRD.)<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, this logo has some nice animation and
should'nt creep too many out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1986-1988)<br>
<br>
<u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Gold Star&quot;, &quot;Streaking Star</font>&quot;<font
face="Arial"><br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: We see a golden, shiny triangle zoom out. Once the
triangle is fully developed, a star shape inside the triangle
pushes out, with lots of shining behind it. The star moves to the
right and reveals the word &quot;Atlantic&quot;. The star keeps
moving, leaving a shiney trail behind (that crosses paths with
the other letters) until it reaches the &quot;i&quot; and places
itself on top of it. The trail then becomes more transparent, and
the text &quot;RELEASING CORPORATION&quot; appears with a laser
effect below a line between it and &quot;Atlantic&quot;. The
entire logo then shines.<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: Excellent animation, one of the best efforts from the
80s, the sound effects fit in quite well, and the whole logo
looks super cool when complete.<br>
<br>
<u>Music/Sound</u>: No music, wind sounds start it off, then an
explosion/rocket-type noise is made when the star advances, with
a laser noise for when the other text appears.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Uncommon, usually saved on most Atlantic
releases of the era, usually preceeded by the Paramount logo.
Paramount began releasing the company's films to TV in 1986,
eventually buying the company's assets after its 1988 bankruptcy
(Atlantic Releasing had earlier licensed to Paramount the US
television and home video rights to its library in 1985).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">However, there is another conflict of
interest. MGM has plans to release both Teen Wolf movies and
Valley Girl on DVD. We are not sure why or how MGM got a hold of
these titles. Prints of Atlantic movies do exist with the Viacom-era
Paramount logo preceeding, so this transaction is recent. We will
give you more information as it becomes available, but my best
guess would be that the Atlantic logos should still remain, based
on MGM's past logo preservation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, the sound might
get to some, but this is another fine logo from Atlantic, one
wonders what they would have if they were still around today.</font></p>
