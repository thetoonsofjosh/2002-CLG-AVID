(The Three Mountains In the Credits)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: On a screen we see at the top one of the following
bylines:<br>
<br>
&quot;ADOLPH ZUKOR PRESENTS&quot; (films produced on the East
Coast)<br>
&quot;JESSE L. LASKY PRESENTS&quot; (films produced on the West
Coast)<br>
&quot;ADOPLH ZUKOR AND JESSE L. LASKY PRESENT&quot; (films
produced on both coasts)<br>
<br>
Below this we see the title of the film and a little more info. <br>
<br>
Somewhere on the screen, we see a snowcapped mountain poking out
of a cloud at the bottom. The mountain is surrounded by a ring of
stars. We see text overlapping the mountain reading &quot;A
Paramount Picture&quot;. <br>
<br>
At the bottom of the screen is a box. On either side of the box
there are two Paramount pseudo-logos. Each has a ring of stars
inside a ring. On the pseudo-logo on the right we see the words
&quot;Paramount Pictures&quot;. On the pseuo-logo on the left, we
see some writing. I theorize that this logo may actually be
&quot;Famous Players&quot;, so I may be wrong. <br>
<br>
At the top of the box, we see &quot;COPYRIGHT (year&quot;.<br>
<br>
Inside the box we see the words &quot;FAMOUS PLAYERS-LASKY
CORPORATION&quot; in a large font. Below this in a slightly
smaller font we see the words &quot;ADOLPH ZUKOR PRESIDENT&quot;.
Below Zukor's name, we see the words &quot;NEW YORK CITY&quot;.<br>
<br>
Below the box we see in a large font &quot;ALL RIGHTS RESERVED&quot;.<br>
<br>
The End Variation of this logo<br>
<br>
We see the words &quot;THE END&quot; on the screen. At the top of
the screen is the title of the movie. Below &quot;THE END&quot;,
we see a snowcapped mountain poking out of a cloud at the bottom.
The mountain is surrounded by a ring of stars. We see text
overlapping the mountain reading &quot;A Paramount Picture&quot;.
<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: Nothing. It was actually a big painting in a room,
that was filmed by a cameraman. <br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: Nothing. <br>
<br>
<u>Availablity</u>: Probably still around on Paramount silent
movies. The logo was actually part of the opening credits, and
should be still on there, since Paramount has always owned their
silents. <br>
<br>
A picture showing the filming of this logo, can be found on Page
71 of &quot;A Pictorial History of the Western Film&quot;. <br>

Several variations were used.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Little Lulu original title</u>: After
Lulu's head appeared, the star faded away, and we see the words
&quot;Paramount Presents&quot; at the top of the screen, followed
by &quot;LITTLE LULU&quot; in large printed letters. Below this
we see &quot;by Marge&quot; written out, and then the word &quot;from&quot;
below &quot;by Marge&quot;, this too written out. The words
&quot;SATURDAY EVENING POST&quot; are printed out, and below this
we see the word, &quot;in&quot; written out, and then below it in
large block lettering, the word &quot;TECHNICOLOR&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The backdrop of all of this is the
Paramount mountain and the stars, which remains until after the
words &quot;A FAMOUS STUDIOS PRODUCTION&quot; appear in various
fonts depending on the release year. After this, the mountain
logo disappears.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>NTA Variation</u>: The opening &quot;A
Paramount Picture&quot; title is replaced with the NTA logo, NTA
shows the rest of the opening sequence, except for the fact that
the words &quot;Paramount Presents&quot;, and &quot;in
Technicolor&quot; are blacked out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Little Audrey</u>: After Little Audrey's
head appeared, the words &quot;Little Audrey&quot; appear in
large written out letters. Then the entire logo fades away to a
new title card. On this, we see &quot;Paramount Presents&quot;
then &quot;A NOVELTOON&quot;, written in some unusual font in
capital letters. After this, the Famous Studios logo appears on
an orange screen.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>NTA Variation</u>: Same as for Lulu</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Spinning star, same used for
Popeye.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Either the Little Lulu or
Little Audrey theme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: It all depends on
which PD tape you buy. Most Little Lulu cartoons have U.M.&amp;M.
titles on them. Since only a few Little Audrey cartoons were
included in the U.M.&amp;M. sale, most have Harveytoon titles.
Only one Little Audrey cartoon, &quot;Tarts and Flowers&quot; has
U.M.&amp;M. titles, so most have NTA titles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Now, a few Little Audrey cartoons have
original titles, or recreations of them. However one Little Lulu
cartoon on a Republic Home Video tape has a complete Paramount
logo sequence.</font></p>
