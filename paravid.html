<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1979-1981)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Mountain Silhouette&quot;,
&quot;Black Mountain&quot;, &quot;Rising Mountain&quot;, &quot;Cheesy
Mountain&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a dark blue background, we
zoom out on a silhouette of a mountain. After we zoom out to a
comfortable distance, there is a bright flash behind the
mountain, and white &quot;stars&quot; (they look like circles or
lens flares) appear, as well as &quot;Paramount&quot; (in script,
but closer to the pre-1975 logo). A yellow trapezoidal trail
zooms out from the base, and &quot;HOME VIDEO&quot; zooms out
soon after, crappily chyroned in.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The end result looks like the pre-1967
print logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The flash, the effects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Off the scale. The
stars look cheesy, the &quot;Paramount&quot; font doesn't look
right, and the chyron for &quot;HOME VIDEO&quot; : ) ugh!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A pounding backbeat as the
mountain zooms out, then a synth chord.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: There are logos that
are rare and then those that are so rare that they are classified
as myths. This logo, by far, falls into that last category-the
only record of its existence is on the original print of &quot;Bon
Voyage, Charlie Brown&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Median, the chord and
flash might not sit well with most people. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1982-1986)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Growing Mountain&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background, we see
the abstract mountain logo, with Gulf + Western byline. It begins
to zoom up on us, as the stars and byline zoom past, and grows
bigger until we are literally right on top of the peak of the
mountain. There is a VERY bright flash, and it dies down to the
word &quot;VIDEO&quot; in blue between two blue lines. On top of
this is the Paramount script logo, and besides it, to the right,
is the Paramount abstract mountain with byline.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The growing mountain, the flash</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Flash seems cheesy,
but the rest is okay.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A new-age type tune, similar
to the Columbia Pictures &quot;Sunburst&quot; music.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: A pretty tough find.
Most Paramount releases went for the logo used at the time, but
Television shows and non-Paramount releases have this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: High, the creepy
music, flash, and especially the growing mountain make this a
very bad logo. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1987-)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a background filled with
blue/purple squares, we see a blue square with the Paramount
abstract mountain logo in gold. It shines, then moves and zooms
away as the squares behind it move away, revealing &quot;FEATURE
PRESENTATION&quot; on a tannish background. After a few moments,
it zooms towards us.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Byline</u>: This used whatever byline
Paramount was using at the time: Gulf + Western around 1987,
Paramount Communications from 1990-1994, and Viacom from 1994
onward. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The squares moving away, the
animation on the Paramount square.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The zooming effect on
&quot;FEATURE PRESENTATION&quot; looks like cheap computer
effects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Abridged version of the
Paramount fanfare. An announcer says &quot;And now, we're pleased
to bring you our Feature Presentation.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Sound Variant</u>: A variation exists
where the announcer says &quot;And now, Paramount is pleased to
bring you our Feature Presentation&quot;. This was used with the
Gulf + Western byline.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Appearing on most
Paramount video releases. The Gulf + Western variation is the
toughest find.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None, although the
transition from the zoomed-in logo to the Paramount warning
screen is very jarring.</font> </p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">4th Logo<br>
(2002-)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: An enhanced version of the home video logo that was
seen from 1987 up to now. A full color version of the Ultra
Majestic Mountain (90th Anniversary version) appears in a square
that overlaps a background of four blue squares. A line of light
passes over it, and then the logo flies off and the squares peel
off, pretty much like before. They reveal &quot;FEATURE
PRESENTATION&quot; in a gold-yellow font flying into place, each
word from a different end. The words now float against a dark
cloud background, eventually zooming out towards the screen in a
trail of gold light. The warnings post-logo appear as always. <br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: Separating squares, the words' movements, and the
moving cloud background. <br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: Same as it has been since 1987, announcer says,
&quot;And now we're pleased to bring you our feature presentation&quot;
as always. <br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Should be turning up on more and more
Paramount releases. For one it is on the video of &quot;Changing
Lanes.&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, complements the new movie logo very
nicely. </font></p>
