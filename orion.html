<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo<br>
(1979-1982)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Sliding Rectangles&quot;,
&quot;The Orion/WB Combo Logo&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: On a black screen, two rectangles, one </font><font
color="#0000FF" face="Arial">blue</font><font face="Arial"> and
one </font><font color="#FF8000" face="Arial">orange</font><font
face="Arial">, each one tilted forward at a 45 degree angle (making
them appear like the floor and ceiling of a tunnel), shoot out
towards the center of the screen. When they both connect at the
center of the screen, they tilt back 45 degrees, so that they are
facing the viewer completely, and enlarge to fill the screen. In
the </font><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">blue rectangle</font><font
face="Arial">, which is on the top, we see the</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"> \\'</font><font face="Arial"> logo
and the words &quot;</font><font color="#FF8000" face="Arial">WARNER
BROS.</font><font face="Arial">&quot; in orange. In the orange
rectangle, which is on the bottom, we see the words &quot;</font><font
color="#0000FF" face="Arial">ORION</font><font face="Arial"> (in
the same font as in logo #2) </font><font color="#0000FF"
face="Arial">PICTURES COMPANY</font><font face="Arial"> (in a
more plain font)&quot; in blue. After a while, the blue and
orange rectangles move to each other's spot, briefly overlapping.
&quot;</font><font color="#FF8000" face="Arial">A WARNER
COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY</font><font face="Arial">&quot; and &quot;presents&quot;
fade in under &quot;</font><font color="#FF8000" face="Arial">WARNER
BROS.</font><font face="Arial">&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: The rectangles shooting out, tilting, enlarging,
overlapping, and switching places.<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: All the logo's animation is cheesy.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: Door-locking/jail cell closing-type noises are made
as the rectangles swap and the text changes position.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Was originally seen on such films as &quot;Time
After Time,&quot; &quot;Caddyshack,&quot; and &quot;Chariots of
Fire,&quot; but recent videos and TV broadcasts of those films
use the Warner Communications variation of Orion logo #2. When
American Movie Classics or Turner Classic Movies shows &quot;Time
After Time&quot; or &quot;Chariots of Fire,&quot; the logo is
intact, but in AMC's case, only on the letterbox airings. It
might be seen on some Orion films on the Encore movie channel.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: The animation could get you, but I doubt
anyone would be scared by it. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><a name="movie"></a><font face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1982-1996)<br>
<br>
<u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Starry Sky&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We first see a starry sky,
then a constellation of stars in the middle shine brighter than
the rest. It moves to the left, forms a circle, and spins around
until, in a small flash, it forms a letter &quot;</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">O</font><font face="Arial">.&quot;
Then the letters &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">RION</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; appear (by a sliding effect) to complete the
logo, which is stylized when a line is drawn across it. The
traces of the line remain on the left side of each letter except
the &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">I</font><font
face="Arial">,&quot; which has the line across the whole thing.
&quot;</font><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">An</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; and &quot;</font><font color="#0000FF"
face="Arial">PICTURES RELEASE</font><font face="Arial">&quot; (all
in blue) appear above and below the logo accordingly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Excess Byline</u>: On films released in
1982-83, extra text appeared below and to the right of the logo
reading &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Thru
Warner Bros., A Warner Communications Company</font><font
face="Arial">,&quot; with a little</font><font color="#FFFFFF"
face="Arial"> \\'</font><font face="Arial"> next to &quot;</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">A Warner Communications Company</font><font
face="Arial">.&quot; A different starfield was also used.<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: The stars forming the &quot;O,&quot; the rest of the
logo appearing and the line being drawn on it.<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The constellation appearing and moving<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: A horn fanfare against the background of a
futuristic sound effect. Sometimes uses the beginning of the
movie's music. Can also be silent as well.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Can still be seen on most of the Orion
movies now owned by MGM. The Warner Communications variation can
be seen on recent videos and TV broadcasts of &quot;Caddyshack&quot;
and &quot;Chariots of Fire.&quot; On &quot;The Cotton Club&quot;
on AMC, and many reissues of Orion films on DVD, the normal logo
can be seen with the current MGM logo before it.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Low to Moderate </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo<br>
(1996-98)<br>
<br>
<u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Enhanced Starry Sky&quot;, &quot;Starry
Sky II&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: Exactly the same as the Starry Sky logo, but updated
for the 1990s, with computer effects. The starfield behind the
logo no longer zooms out as the logo forms, but shoots out
towards the screen. The animation is the same, but the stars now
have a &quot;trail&quot; that forms the &quot;O&quot;, and the
forming of the actual logo is different, with a laser light
forming the line in the logo. The logo itself is now silvery and
3D, and only &quot;PICTURES&quot; appears below the logo.<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: THIS is how you update a logo. The same thing as the
popular Starry Sky logo, but the nice computer animation and
trueness to the original have made this a favorite of those who
have seen it.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: Begins with a variation of the &quot;futuristic
sound effect&quot; in the original Starry Sky, then a soft but
majestic horn tune. As the logo begins to form, it gets faster
and faster, culminating in a majestic hit and three-note sounder.
Fantastic music.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Sadly, used very, very little, although the
musical version can be seen on Encore's prints of &quot;Body Slam&quot;.
A version without music is present on &quot;8 Heads in a Duffel
Bag&quot;. This logo was probably used more for updated prints
rather than movies released in the era, but either way, not much.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: None, it would be very popular if the logo
was used more frequently. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Orion Home Video<br>
</B></font><font face="Arial">1st Logo<br>
(1988-1990)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: On the Orion star background, a comet streaks by,
forming the familiar Orion logo, with &quot;HOME VIDEO&quot;
below it. The logo shines.<br>
<br>
<u>Variations</u>: On videos that did not have the Orion Pictures
logo, the logo abruptly ends at this point. On videos that did
have an Orion Pictures logo, the beginning of that logo would
form, and the Orion Home Video logo would shrink into the top
star. The Orion Pictures logo continued as normal.<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: Nice star effects, though nowhere near as good as the
next effort...<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: None.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Scarce/Rare-most of the back catalog's been
reissued by MGM Home Entertainment; check your video store's
backstock.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1990-1997)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: On a star background, the five stars fade into view.
Instead of moving to form the O, they break formation and swirl
around, forming an outline of the Orion logo that quickly fills
with silver. &quot;HOME VIDEO&quot; then moves from the bottom of
the screen to join the Orion logo, and they both shine.<br>
<br>
At this point, one of two endings would appear:</font> </p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">The stars from the beginning would
        return, swirling around the logo, causing it to disappear.</font>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The beginning of the Orion Pictures
        logo begins behind the Orion Pictures logo, as the stars
        return again to swirl around the logo. &quot;HOME VIDEO&quot;
        shimmers out, and the Orion logo shrinks to the top star.</font>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: OUTSTANDING animation. Many
people prefer this to the movie logo, and the transition from
this to the movie logo is just the icing on the cake.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: The Orion fanfare. For movies that have Orion
Pictures with fanfare, the music is extended to cover both logos.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Same as 1st HV logo</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Absolutely none. A
wonderful logo. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Orion Television<br>
</B></font><font face="Arial">(1982-1996)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: Same as the </font><a href="#movie"><font
face="Arial">movie logo</font></a><font face="Arial"> of the era,
but we start at the animation where the stars spin around. The
forming of &quot;ORION&quot; is the same, then &quot;TELEVISION&quot;
(in white, similar font to ORION, in caps) appears below, just as
wide as the &quot;RION&quot; segment of the above text.<br>
<br>
<u>Variations</u>: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">This logo sometimes appears without
        the additional &quot;Television&quot; text</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Most first-run shows were ID'ed as a
        presentation of &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF"
        face="Arial">ORION Television Syndication</font><font
        face="Arial">.&quot; Some of them having the logo
        superimposed over the closing credits.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">On the 1990 pilot of the game show
        Gambit, the logo was animated as usual, but the text
        &quot;Television Entertainment&quot; was under.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The flashing of the &quot;O,&quot;
the rest of the logo appearing and the line being drawn on it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Usually have the ending theme
play over.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Rare, was seen on many
late 80s game shows, like &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and
&quot;High Rollers&quot;, and the version with only the &quot;Orion&quot;
text is seen on reruns of 75-79 Saturday Night Live eps. Cagney
and Lacey reruns shown a few years ago on TNN usually had this
logo on (with the &quot;TELEVISION&quot; text).</font></p>
