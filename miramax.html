<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1st Logo</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1980s-1999)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: "The
Big M"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
black background, we see a blue "M" momentarily filling the screen,
then zooming out to a distance. It stops, and then slowly starts to
move to the right, revealing the golden letters of "MIRAMAX" as it
goes. After it reveals the "A", it flashes/explodes to reveal an "X".
The word "FILMS", sandwiched between two bars and spaced so that it
matches the width of "MIRAMAX", appears. Then, the outline of a giant
"M", glowing in blue, zooms out to encase the Miramax logo.</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Early Variation</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: For a number of years until Disney acquired the
company, the word "Presents", blue and in script, would appear under
the "MIRAMAX FILMS" logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Home Entertainment Variation</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Miramax adapted their logo for their Home
Entertainment division. It is the same as the movie logo, although
the logo is now on videotape and runs at a smoother frame rate,
rendering it even more cheesy than before. "HOME ENTERTAINMENT"
replaces "FILMS".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
zooming out of the M, the glowing letters, the flash, the "Big
M"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
All 80s glowing effects, and the "M" zooming out at the beginning
seems to be going in slow/delayed motion like the MTM kitten.</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Rather
subdued new-age type music.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
On many, MANY movies released by this company. Not hard to find at
all.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Well, the flash might get to some, but it's pretty harmless.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">2nd Logo</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1999-)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: "The
City"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: We zoom
down a river, and pan up to see the skyline of a city, at sundown. As
the sun sets, the lights in the building windows begin to turn on,
like normal when it is sundown. As we zoom in closer to the
buildings, several lights begin forming the Miramax Films logo,
simply in white (no glowy effects like last time). The city skyline
fades to black as the Miramax Films logo forms, piece by piece, zooms
towards the center of the screen.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Variation</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: For
this logo's first year, the word "20th Anniversary" appears
above.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Home Entertainment Variation</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Again, Miramax's Home Entertainment division adapted
this logo. It's on videotape and shot at a faster frame rate, and
again "HOME ENTERTAINMENT" replaces "FILMS".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Stunning
CGI effects.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Not
confirmed as of yet, but "Music of the Heart" has the beginning of
that movie's theme there.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Not widely seen, as this logo has just begun use and Miramax's films
aren't that widely distributed.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Absolutely none. This is a GREAT logo, stunning CGI, design, and
nifty idea. Has the potential to be a fan favorite if/when it is seen
more widely.</FONT></P>
