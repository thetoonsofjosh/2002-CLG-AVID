<p><font color="#808040" size="4" face="Arial"><b>WCI HOME VIDEO</B></font><font
color="#808040" face="Arial"> (WCI standing for &quot;Warner
Communications, Inc.&quot;)</font><br>
<font color="#808040" face="Arial">(1978-1980)</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The
Big \\' &quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We start out
with a *VERY BIG* \\' logo (that is white with a blue &quot;tube&quot;)
that fills the entire screen. It then zooms back slightly. Then
above the logo, the words &quot;WCI HOME VIDEO&quot; between two
horizontal lines appear, followed by a much smaller \\' logo
besides &quot;A Warner Communications Company&quot;. The logo
faded from black after the standard FBI Warning Screen and had a
more-grainy film like quality to it. The W logo is slightly
smaller than on the later Warner Home Video version of the logo.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>SFX/Cheesy Factor</u>:
The &quot;zooming out&quot; of the logo, not to mention the film
scratches.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Most
WCI releases had no logo, and went from Warning screen to the
Warner logo in use at the time. The only video this logo has been
seen on to date is &quot;Every Which Way But Loose&quot; with
Clint Eastwood.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low.
The fade from black to the logo may startle you.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#808040" size="4" face="Arial"><b>WARNER HOME
VIDEO</B></font><br>
<font color="#808040" face="Arial">1st Logo</font><br>
<font color="#808040" face="Arial">(1980-1986)</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Same as #1,
except the logo is better quality, with WCI HOME VIDEO replaced
by WARNER HOME VIDEO, The FBI Warning Screen now cuts directly to
this logo. The \\&quot; logo is a little bigger as well.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>SFX/Cheesy Factor</u>:
Same as #1, minus the film scractches.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Seen
on Warner Home Video releases of the era. These releases are
easily to spot because they were released in clamshell packaging,
with some videos from 1985-1986 released in cardboard jackets.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low.
The transition from the FBI Warning screen to this logo is sudden
and jarring, but this logo is otherwise harmless.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial">2nd Logo</font><br>
<font color="#808040" face="Arial">(1986-1996)</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The
Cheesy Shield&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Over a time-lapse
animation of clouds, the camera zooms out between the tops of
some letters and the bottom of what appears to be a line. The
camera then zooms out and the logo turns towards us, revealing
that it is the words &quot;WARNER HOME VIDEO&quot; with two lines
above it and two lines below it. It then zooms out to the bottom
of the screen , followed by a giant WB Shield logo appearing from
the top of the screen, slightly tilted to the bottom, then
rotating to face us. The Warner disclaimer appears at the bottom
of the screen. &quot;Sparkles&quot; appear and white &quot;reflections&quot;
appear on the logo.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Bylines</u>: </font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial">This logo had several
different bylines on the bottom of the screen:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#808040" face="Arial">1986-1990: A
        Subsidiary Of Warner Bros., A Warner Communications
        Company </font></li>
    <li><font color="#808040" face="Arial">1990-1992: A
        Subsidiary of Warner Bros., A Time Warner Company</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#808040" face="Arial">1992-1996: A Time
        Warner Entertainment Company</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: &quot;time-lapse&quot;
cloud animation, WB shield rotating into place.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>:
Relatively primitive CGI along with the &quot;time-lapse&quot;
cloud animation. Cheap synth theme as well.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A proud,
bombastic synthesized theme that really fit the logo. As a
sidenote, a lusher orchestrated theme with the same notes as the
HV logo was briefly used as the fanfare for the movie WB shield
when it returned to usage in 1984.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Seen
on every Warner Home Video release from 1986 to 1996.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>:
Median, the bombastic music and primitive CGI may scare some, but
this logo is a favorite of many.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial">3rd Logo</font><br>
<font color="#808040" face="Arial">(1996-)</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Invisible/Visible
Shield&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Against a
backdrop of clouds, a clear WB shield with a wordless banner
slowly fades into view. Then the words &quot;WARNER HOME VIDEO&quot;
are wiped onto the banner as the colors slowly appear on the
shield.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Variant</u>: In 1998,
like other Warner labels, a 75th Anniversary version was made.
This used a smaller, bannerless shield, and had a 75 across it.
&quot;YEARS ENTERTAINING THE WORLD&quot; would also been seen
below.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>SFX/Cheesy Factor</u>: A
simple, effective logo animation, nothing really cheesy except
for the &quot;wiping&quot; on of the &quot;WARNER HOME VIDEO&quot;
text.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A rather
quiet piano tune.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>:
Currently in use.</font></p>

<p><font color="#808040" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None,
this is a clean logo.</font> </p>
