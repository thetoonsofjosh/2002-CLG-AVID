<p><font face="Arial"><u>What's Comedy Partners?</u></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This channel is owned by an outfit called
&quot;Comedy Partners&quot;. Who are they? None other than Viacom
and Time Warner. How did this take place? Time Warner's HBO unit
had expanded into basic cable with a channel called &quot;Comedy
Channel&quot;. Similarly, Viacom was operating &quot;HA! The
Comedy Network&quot;. After both channels took a hit, the two
compromised and created a jointly-owned company, Comedy Partners,
and HA! And Comedy Channel were merged into Comedy Central. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo<br>
(1992-1996?)<br>
<br>
<u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The Junkyard&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: The Comedy Central globe of the era (which does not
tilt to a side, has yellow text, and a purplish top) is posed in
a background of spare tires, kind of like a junkyard. The &quot;Comedy
Central&quot; marquee spins around from time to time.<br>
<br>
<u>SFX/Cheesy Factor</u>: The animated CC logo plastered in a
&quot;real&quot; background.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: None, just Penn Gilette saying, &quot;This has been
a presentation from Comedy Central!&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Seen in the CC-era of &quot;Mystery Science
Theater 3000&quot; up to the sixth season.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Penn's bombastic voice might startle some. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1996-97)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The ATM&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: It begins with a shot of a
credit card being inserted into what is presumably an ATM machine.
It then switches to a shot of an &quot;ATM Screen&quot;. In </font><font
color="#000000" face="Arial">green</font><font face="Arial">,
being &quot;drawn&quot; down from top to bottom and in a computer-type
font, are the words &quot;</font><font color="#80FF80"
face="Arial">THIS HAS BEEN A PRESENTATION OF</font><font
face="Arial">&quot;, followed by the Comedy Central logo (in </font><font
color="#000000" face="Arial">green</font><font face="Arial">),
and then &quot;</font><font color="#80FF80" face="Arial">THANK
YOU FOR YOUR PATRONAGE</font><font face="Arial">&quot;. The last
line &quot;blinks&quot; a few times, becoming highlighted in </font><font
color="#000000" face="Arial">green</font><font face="Arial"> with
the text in black.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Variant</u>:</font><font
face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">An interesting
edit exists on one of the first South Park eps, where the &quot;credit
card&quot; animation was kept in but then abruptly switching to
Logo 3!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX/Cheesy Factor</u>: The &quot;ATM
Screen&quot;, but that was intentional.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: &quot;Beeping&quot; sounds,
like a real atm.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Rare, was seen on
Comedy Central shows of the period, also originally on the first
episodes of &quot;South Park&quot; but this was covered up with
Logo 3 (and soon after, logo 4). The credit card animation is
still retained on some early episodes of Win Ben Stein's Money,
but then shifts to the '00 logo. Video tapes of South Park can
still contain this logo. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Not scary at all and
very creative. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo<br>
(1997-98)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The Transmitter&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a </font><font
color="#0000FF" face="Arial">blue</font><font face="Arial">
background with &quot;wavy lines&quot;, the Comedy Central logo
appears at the bottom, at first distorted but soon becoming clear.
The transmitter on the top of the logo &quot;activates&quot; and
then many &quot;This has been a presentation of&quot; rings begin
to come out of the transmitter.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The &quot;Transmitter&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: An &quot;interference&quot;
sound followed by loud &quot;bong&quot; sounds as the &quot;rings&quot;
come out from the transmitter.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Usually plastered by
the current logo, but is still found on some of the early VHS
tapes of South Park. Comedy Central's recent showing of the South
Park episode &quot;Cartman's Mom Is A Dirty Slut&quot; kept this
logo, suprisingly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Not scary at all. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">4th Logo<br>
(1998-2000)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a </font><font
color="#000000" face="Arial">red</font><font face="Arial"> screen
with what looks like bubbles crashing into each other (like a
lava lamp), the comedy central logo, now in </font><font
color="#000000" face="Arial">white</font><font face="Arial">,
zooms in from the center of the screen, glowing. Above it is
&quot;THIS HAS BEEN A PRESENTATION OF&quot;, and below it is the
copyright information for the show(usually ©(year) Comedy
Partners, Inc. All Rights Reserved.)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Variants</u>: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The screen has also been seen
        in blue and green.</font> </li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">In later years, </font><a
        href="http://www.comedycentral.com"><font size="2"
        face="Arial">www.comedycentral.com</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> was seen on the logo</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Well, the zoom-in looks lame,
as does the logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A low &quot;WHOOSH&quot; as
the logo zooms in.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Rare, the current logo
is now plastering all past logos, but was spotted on &quot;The
Firar's Club Roast Of Jerry Stiller&quot; in May 2002.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Lame but harmless. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">5th Logo <br>
(2000-) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Over a shaded orange
background, we see lots of yellow circles zooming toward the
viewer. The circles have zoomed-up bits of the latest Comedy
Central logo (much like the original, but with a different font)
and other text to be seen at the end product. When the circles
are done, we are treated with the end product, the updated Comedy
Central logo in the center with &quot;THIS HAS BEEN A
PRESENTATION OF&quot; above in black, and &quot;</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">comedycentral.com</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; below, in white. There is a backdrop of
circles zooming behind the logo. There are also versions using
blue and green backgrounds.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variant</u>: On later seasons of &quot;South
Park&quot;, this logo starts with the finished product on many
episodes, bypassing the circles. A copyright notice for Comedy
Partners is included. A few episodes keep the animation as usual,
but still have the copyright notice, plastered over all animation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Pretty inspired animation,
nothing cheesy, but can make the viewer a bit dizzy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A bass sounder that loops
itself, not unlike music heard on Comedy Central's commercial
tags.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Common, at least on
Comedy Central. Is seen on all original Comedy Central
programming, such as &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;,
and &quot;The Man Show.&quot; This logo has also been plastered
Columbia-Tristar style on nearly all pre-2000 original
programming as well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None, it can get a bit
tiresome, but the colors are too bright to scare anyone.</font></p>
