<hr>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial">1st Logo</font><br>
<font color="#0080FF" face="Arial">(1924-1936)</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>:
&quot;Early Torch Lady&quot;, &quot;Sparkler Torch Lady&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We see a
medium shot of a lady (Columbia, a representation of the USA),
holding a light torch in her right hand. The lady is featured
with a dark bob and a kind of Cleopatra-like headdress across her
forehead. She is draped in an American flag complete with the
stars on her left shoulder and the stripes coming across her
middle, supported by her left arm, and hanging down her right
side. Her torch is displayed with a rather primitive, flickering
style of animation emitting lines of light as rays. The torch
lady's head is under an arch of chiseled-though square shaped
letters reading the words &quot;A Columbia Production&quot;. At
the end of the movie, the words are... &quot;This Is A Columbia
Picture&quot; with &quot;The End&quot; below it.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>Variant</u>:
Some movies would feature the name in another typeface, and will
sometimes be ID'ed as &quot;Columbia Pictures Corporation&quot;
at the start of the film, and &quot;A Columbia Production&quot;
at the end of the film.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>SFX/Cheesy Factor</u>:
The torch rays shining like fireworks and sparklers, which look
silly, but the logo is from the 20s, so give them credit.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A majestic
horn sounder, much like the Fox logo.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Can
still be seen on reruns of early (w/o Schemp) Three Stooges
shorts on AMC.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Median</font></p>

<font color="#0080FF" face="Arial">(1936-1975)</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>:
&quot;Classic Torch Lady&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We see the
lady, this time standing on top of a pedestal with a backdrop of
clouds over her, while she is holding her light torch. Much more
refined, ethereal and goddess-like, her facial features became
less pronounced and she looked away (up and to the right) instead
of straight ahead. Her headdress was removed and her hair swept
back instead of hanging by the sides of her face. The drape over
her shoulder became less-obviously an American flag, the stars on
the left shoulder having been toned down in a shadow, and the
stripes visible only on the portion of the drape hanging down her
right side. &quot;A Columbia Production&quot; was replaced with
the tall chiseled letters of &quot;COLUMBIA&quot; (which fades in
a second afterward) running straight across the top section of
the screen, with the lady's torch glowing in front of the
&quot;U&quot;. A new form of animation was used on the logo as
well, with a torch that radiates light instead of flickers.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>History/Evolution</u>:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#0080FF" size="2" face="Arial">1949: The
        lady looks much as she had in 1936, only the stripes were
        removed and the flag became simply a drape without
        markings, dark on the left shoulder but only the shadows
        of the folds differentiating the rest of it from the
        lady's white gown on her right side. The
        &quot;COLUMBIA&quot; lettering was also modified, still
        chiseled but less bold, and with darker shadowing. </font></li>
    <li><font color="#0080FF" size="2" face="Arial">1950s: The
        Columbia Lady's robe was redrawn with a plunging
        neckline. </font></li>
    <li><font color="#0080FF" size="2" face="Arial">Late 1960s:
        She lost her slipper-clad foot peeking out from the
        bottom of her robe as it divided just above the pedestal.
        Also, the clouds behind the logo became concentrated in
        the center and more billowy in shape. The drapery was
        temporarily all white during this era.</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#0080FF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>Byline</u>:
Starting in 1973-74, the phrase &quot;A Division of Columbia
Pictures Industries&quot; appears at the bottom of the screen.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The torch rays
shine more realistically in this version.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Usually, the
beginning of a movie's opening score plays over the logo. On some
films, the logo appears completely silent.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>:
Uncommon, can still be seen on various broadcasts of classic
Columbia movies, as Sony preserves their movie logos well.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>:
Median, the old B/W film and scary drawing might send some
chills.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial">3rd Logo</font><br>
<font color="#0080FF" face="Arial">(December 1975-1981)</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>:
&quot;Torch Lady&quot; ---&gt; &quot;The Abstract Torch&quot;,
&quot;The Sunburst&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: It begins with
the familiar Columbia Torch Lady, standing on the pedestal
holding her light torch. Then, the picture moves upward and
towards the torch, which shines even more as the picture blurs
around it. It then emits a flash that fills the screen. When the
flash dissolves, the light torch itself appears, as if in
sunburst, against a black screen and as it shrinks, it changes
into a more &quot;abstract&quot; torch: a blue half circle, or a
semicircle, with thirteen white light rays in the center and the
words &quot;Columbia Pictures&quot; under it. The entire logo
then slowly backs away as it fades out.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The Torch
Lady's torch being zoomed in on, then turning into the Sunburst.</font></p>

<p><a name="sunm"></a><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>:
The movie theme begins with a dramatic theme that builds up as
the camera zooms in on the torch. With the flash/sunburst, it
takes an inspirational, majestic tone. Of course, like many other
movie logos, this could also be silent or have the opening theme
play over it, but usually not. </font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>:
Actually more common than the TV version, as Sony is much better
at keeping old logos on video releases of their movies. So you
can usually still see the Torch Lady/Sunburst combination on
movies from the time period. You can usually see it on cable
movie channels as well.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>:
Minimal, this was/is a favorite of many.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial">4th Logo</font><br>
<font color="#0080FF" face="Arial">(1981-1993)</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;80s
Torch Lady&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We see the
standard Columbia torch lady (a somewhat less detailed version of
the '70s Torch Lady; she also appears to be resembling Da Vinci's
Mona Lisa) standing on a pedestal with her torch. The torch then
shines into a bright abstract shape, as if in sunburst, then dims
back in place. The words &quot;Columbia Pictures&quot; fade to
the left and right of the Torch Lady. Her torch
&quot;shines&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>Variant</u>:
After 1988, the logo fades in and then the company name fades in
about a second afterward. There was no big bright light in this
variation.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>SFX/Cheesy Factor</u>:
The torch lady &quot;shining&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None, but on
one occasion, had used the </font><a href="#sunm"><font
color="#0080FF" face="Arial">Sunburst music</font></a><font
color="#0080FF" face="Arial">, which was probably a goof-up. Too
bad, it kinda went well with this logo.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Still
saved on all movies when reran on cable or syndication, but the
earlier variation is easier to come by, due to being used a
longer time period and being on more popular movies.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>:
Minimal.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial">5th Logo</font><br>
<font color="#0080FF" face="Arial">(1993-)</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;90s
Torch Lady&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: This logo has
a face lifted torch lady of the 1930s-70s on her pedestal, giving
more detail to the drawing. First, we see a bright light, as if
in sunburst. The light is coming from a torch, which zooms out to
reveal the person who's holding it. On the top
&quot;COLUMBIA&quot;, seen in a bold, silver chiseled font, fades
in afterward as a ring of light shimmers around the lady.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>Byline</u>:
Starting in late 1996, &quot;A Sony Pictures Entertainment
Company&quot;, appears on the bottom.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>The
&quot;Making Of&quot; the 90s Torch Lady</u>: The logo's most
recent overhaul was undertaken during this era when Sony Pictures
Entertainment (which bought Columbia in 1989) commissioned
illustrator Michael J. Deas to redesign the lady and return her
to her &quot;classic&quot; look. The result, based on Deas'
sessions with Mandeville, Louisiana homemaker Jenny Joseph who
posed for him with a makeshift robe and torch, was a taller,
slimmer Columbia Torch Lady with lighter, curlier hair and a
dimmer torch. Rather than use Joseph's face however, Deas
constructed a composite face made up of several
computer-generated features.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Zooming out of
the torch.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A majestic
tune is heard. Ends with a brass sounder.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Pretty
easy to find, as it's in current use. More movies from this era
are now being shown on basic cable, so it's common, but
thankfully, not plastering anything.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None,
nothing scary about it, has a beautiful fanfare, and a soothing
backdrop.</font></p>
