<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1924-)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The MGM Lion&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: A live-action lion is in a
circle of a ribbon-like filmstrip which has four filmstrips
flowing out on the bottom sides in twos. Underneath the circle is
a red drama mask. The circle has the phrase &quot;ARS GRATIA
ARTIS&quot; [Latin for &quot;Art for the Art's Sake&quot;]
inscribed on the top, and at the bottom is a marquee that reads
&quot;Metro Goldwyn Mayer.&quot;&nbsp; On the left side is &quot;TRADE,&quot;
and the right &quot;MARK.&quot; The lion roars twice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variations</u>: First here are the few
differences in the logo, along with dates in which they were used:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">Mid 1950s-1956: The marquee is
        dropped, and the company name is placed on top of the
        ribbon design. The first letters of the company's name
        are in red, and the rest of the letters are in tan.</font>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Early 1957: A different lion is seen
        in this logo. It appears as if it is snarling.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1957-82: The ribboning is stretched
        farther out from the bottom; a brand new lion appears in
        this variation.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1974: Company celebrates its Golden
        Anniversary, adding the disclaimer &quot;Beginning Our
        Next 50 Years&quot;. (as seen on &quot;That's
        Entertainment&quot;)</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1982: The company identified as MGM/UA
        Entertainment Company, following their acquisition of
        United Artists. This logo variant is accompanied by a new
        lion roar track.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1984: &quot;Diamond Jubilee: Sixty
        Years of Great Entertainment&quot; is used. The ribboning
        was golden colored for this variation. Because of the
        above disclaimer, the company name is now inscribed
        around the ribboning where &quot;ARS GRATIA ARTIS&quot;
        is usually seen.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1985-1987: Company name is placed back
        on top of the ribboning, which has reverted back to white.</font>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1987-: The Company is reverted back to
        Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The ribboning and the company name
        are now golden colored and will remain this way from this
        point forward.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1999: 75th Anniversary logo; &quot;75,
        a Legacy of Excellence&quot; is used.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1998-: The logo is adapted for MGM's
        renamed video division, MGM Home Entertainment. The logo
        is pushed up and &quot;HOME ENTERTAINMENT&quot;, between
        two lines, is added below.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">2001-: A &quot;www.mgm.com&quot; web
        address is added below the logo.</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX/Cheesy Factor</u>: The roaring lion
effect, which really does not sound like a lion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Can still be seen on
many classic films aired on Turner Classic Movies and American
Movie Classics, as well as current MGM releases.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: One of the best-known
logos, but high on the scary side for people who don't like
roaring lions. The red mask on the bottom has freaked a few out
as well.</font></p>
