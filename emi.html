<hr>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Background</u>: This company was the
former Associated British Corporation (best known for producing
&quot;The Avengers&quot;). Associated British went bankrupt in
1968 and its assets (Associated British Film Distributors,
Elstree Studios, the ABC Cinemas movie theater chain and Thames
Television) were purchased by EMI Records. EMI bought British
Lion Films in 1976, folding it into the company.<br>
<br>
</font><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>EMI Film Distributors
Limited</strong></font><font face="Arial"><br>
1st Logo<br>
(1968-1976?)<br>
<br>
<u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Black Monument&quot;, &quot;The Black
Tombstone&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>:On a black screen, we see the company name stacked
Fox-like in a &quot;chiseled&quot; font, not unlike that carved
into monuments, positioned near the upper-right of the screen.
The placement is like this:<br>
EMI (in large letters)<br>
FILM (im smaller letters)<br>
DISTRIBUTORS LIMITED (in very small letters)<br>
<br>
<u>Variation</u>: On a few films, we see on the same black
background this text centered in the middle of the screen: NAT
COHEN PRESENTS FOR EMI FILM DISTRIBUTORS. Movies with this
version end with the text A NAT COHEN PRESENTATION FOR EMI FILM
DISTRIBUTORS. The text is a variant of the font used for the
standard logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None, apart from the name
fading onto the screen<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The monument plaque-style font used<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: None<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Not widely seen in the US due to replacement
with American distributors' logos. Was discovered on the mid-1990s
Republic Pictures Home Video release of Hammer Films' &quot;Scars
of Dracula&quot;. The Nat Levine variant was found on the
Showtime Networks print of the Roger Corman sex comedy &quot;Candy
Stripe Nurses&quot; (apparently an UK print was used).<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Median, due to the lettering being similar
to that carved onto tombstones , but has lower levels for the Nat
Cohen version due to the smaller font used. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1976?-81)<br>
<br>
<u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Blue EMI&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: On a blue screen, we see the letters EMI (in the
familiar logo's font) zoom toward the center of the screen. As
the letters move, the box draws itself into place forming the
familiar EMI logo. The phrase EMI FILM DISTRIBUTORS then fades
into place.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In later years, the byline A MEMBER OF THE
THORN GROUP along with the Thorn logo appears instead of the
company name (EMI merged with Thorn plc around 1979, hence the
name and logo described below). On some films, this was
superimposed onto the film's opening credit sequence.<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: The EMI lettering zoom-in, the rectangle drawing
itself in<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Rather simple animation, even for the 1970s.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None, except as explained
below.<br>
<br>
<u>Avaliability</u>: Rare/Scarce-Check your local home video
stores for older VHS releases of the company's films.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: TBA</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>EMI Films,Inc.</strong><br>
(1977-83)<br>
<br>
<u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Blue EMI&quot;,&quot;The Record Dudes&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Background</u>: EMI opened an American subsidiary of EMI Film
Distributors in 1977, with a television division (EMI Television
Productions) and its own distribution unit. In 1979, the
distribution unit was closed and they went through ITC's
Associated Film Distribution unit for its theatrical releases.
The company's final films (The Deer Hunter, Bad Boys and The
Philadelphia Experiment) were released through Universal* and
Paramount before it was closed down.<br>
(*EMI and Universal co-produced The Deer Hunter.)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: In the opening scene of a movie, a superimposed EMI
logo appears just like its British counterpart, except that the
legend EMI FILMS,INC. appears under it. &quot;PRESENTS&quot; is
also below everything else.<br>
<br>
<u>Variations</u>:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">In The Jazz Singer (the 1980 Neil
        Diamond version), the still EMI logo appears superimposed
        in the style of the opening credit sequence.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The notorious Village People movie
        Can't Stop The Music had the EMI logo appearing as if it
        was made of solid gold.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">A Wringer In The Bunch:The Deer Hunter
        opened with the Universal Globe followed by a black and
        white EMI Film Distributors ID (Thorn byline version).</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The same as the second EMI Film
Distributors logo; also appeared as a still image on later films<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Same as its British counterpart</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: The the movie's opening score
<br>
<br>
<u>Availiability</u>: Rare-given the rather low output of its US
branch, but this logo is an easier find than the British
counterpart. It is retained on Convoy, The Jazz Singer (1980) and
Can't Stop The Music among others<br>
(having been used as an in-credit logo in the States).<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Relatively harmless, given American
audiences' familiarity with the logo (via the EMI-America record
label and the parent company's ownership of Capitol Records).
However, some might be mildly frightened by the animated version.
</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>EMI Television Productions,Inc.</strong><br>
(1977-80)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: As the closing credits finish, the credit A ROGER
GIMBEL PRODUCTION FOR appears on the screen in a rounded blocky
font, arranged in a semi-circular stack seen like this:<br>
<br>
A<br>
ROGER<br>
GIMBEL<br>
PRODUCTION <br>
FOR<br>
[Note:&quot;A&quot; and &quot;FOR&quot; appear in smaller
print,while Gimbel's name appears in larger print.]<br>
Then this fades and the EMI logo appears just like its British
theatrical counterpart except that here the phrase EMI TELEVISION
PRODUCTIONS,INC. is seen under the logo. Both the Gimbel credit
and EMI logo are superimposed over the end-credit montage.<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: The same animation as the EMI Film Distributors logo.<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Gimbel's credit popping onto the screen in
that big font.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: The outro of the theme music.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Rare-retained on its
productions where aired (often followed by the Viacom V of Doom
on most still-circulating prints).<br>
[Among the notable TV movies it produced were Dead Man's Curve
and The Legend of Walks Far Woman.] <br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Minimal to High because of the Gimbel credit
appearing in very large letters for the first part and the EMI
logo animation in the second. The large font seen on-screen may
startle some but familiarity with EMI's logo from record labels
and Capitol Records'album covers tempers this quite a bit.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Thorn EMI Film Distributors/Screen
Entertainment</strong><br>
(1979-86)<br>
<br>
<u>An explanation here</u>: EMI merged with Thorn plc, an
electronics, electrical and heavy equipment manufacturer and
rental store franchise operator, in 1979. The company and its
library were sold to Cannon Films in 1986. The film library was
subseqently sold to Weintraub and Lumiére Picutres before the
latter company was bought by Canal+ in 1996. Elstree Studios is
now owned by the BBC.<br>
<br>
Thorn EMI &quot;demerged&quot; back into two separate companies
in 1996.<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: On the same blue background as its predecessor, a
white box containing an inverted stylized &quot;T&quot; (which
resembles a thumbtack) zooms in towards the audience. As it moves
into place, we see a smaller rectangular section under the Thorn
&quot;T&quot; that reads THORN EMI. The box completes its journey
and we see the logo of Thorn-EMI and then the sequence fades out.<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: The warp-speed zoom-in.<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The rather tacky (excuse the crummy pun)
look of the logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None-this is a silent logo.<br>
<br>
[Note:This logo is famiiar to Britons because of Thorn brand
light bulbs (the logo only has THORN in the space where the Thorn
EMI name would be) and electrical appliances.] <br>
<br>
<u>Availiability</u>: Extinct, due to the ownership shifts
explained above. This was plastered over the previous EMI Film
Distributors and Associated British IDs on most library prints it
issued to the US market. You would have to search for EMI Film
Distributors library titles issued by Thorn EMI Video during the
1980s or off-air videotapes of any EMI-owned movie. Otherwise,
you'd better expect the StudioCanal logo on current prints.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: A little on the high side for those who fear
objects suddenly coming forward at high speed but once again
harmess for most viewers.</font></p>
