<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo<br>
(1960s-Mid 1970s)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Filmways Globe&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We start with a small globe of
Earth, horizontally stretched out in the center of the screen.
The globe has latitude (left to right) lines on it, and the
equator extends beyond the globe, with little Richter-scale like
lines on part of it. The globe is on a blue, starry background,
with most of the stars clumped in the upper left and right hand
corners. Now, to the action. From behind the globe, the text
&quot;A FILMWAYS&quot;, in a 3D font and curved to match the
globe's position, zoom in a north-forward direction. Shortly
after, the text &quot;TELEVISION PRESENTATION&quot; fades in
below the globe. Sometimes, the Seal of Good Practice appears
below. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The waves, the zooming up of
&quot;FILMWAYS&quot; with the rest of the text.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music/Sound</u>: At least on Filmways'
more sucessful shows, there would be a voice over saying &quot;This
has been a Filmways presentation.&quot; Those who muttered the
phrase are listed below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Voiceovers</u>: Several voiceovers who
said &quot;This has been a Filmways presentation&quot; on this
logo on the shows they appeared on.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">Petticoat Junction: Kate Bradley (played
        by Bea Benaderet) </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Green Acres: Lisa Douglas (played by
        Eva Gabor) says it with &quot;Dahhling&quot;.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Beverly Hillbillies: Ellie May
        Clampett (played by Donna Douglas) </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Mr. Ed: Alan &quot;Rocky&quot; Lane (voice
        of Mister Ed)</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Addams Family: It usually had it
        silent, but on a few episodes, the usual phrase was said
        in a deep baritone voice. It could've been Ted &quot;Lurch&quot;
        Cassidy, but if so, he did not say it in his usual &quot;Lurch&quot;
        voice.</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Uncommon, still seen
on syndie reruns of &quot;Mr. Ed,&quot; &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot;
and &quot;Green Acres.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Minimal, mainly it can
catch you off guard. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Filmways Trail&quot;
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black screen, many
differently-colored &quot;Filmways&quot; zoom up from the bottom
of the screen, towards a white &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF"
face="Arial">Filmways</font><font face="Arial">.&quot; All the
multicolored &quot;Filmways&quot; merge into the white &quot;</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Filmways</font><font face="Arial">.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor/SFX</u>: The &quot;merging&quot;
of the &quot;Filmways&quot;, somewhat reminiscent of the 1975-82
Filmation logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A synthesized orchestrated
tune edited with xylophone scales.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Can be seen on &quot;Fangface&quot;
(without music), and the first season of &quot;Thundarr the
Barbarian&quot; (with music).&nbsp; Also appears on Cartoon
Network at the end of some Ruby-Spears pre-1981 shows on some
occasion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Minimal, unless you
never saw it before </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo<br>
(1981-1983)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background, a round
orange glow of light appears, and in it a light blue light forms
a logo. Underneath, the words &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF"
face="Arial">FILMWAYS TELEVISION</font><font face="Arial">&quot;
(in the same font as logo 2) fly back with a</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"> whitish </font><font
color="#3333FF" face="Arial">blue</font><font face="Arial"> light
trail effect.&nbsp; Both the logo and the words turn solid as the
lights fade, with the logo turning</font><font color="#3333FF"
face="Arial"> blue </font><font face="Arial">and the words</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"> white</font><font face="Arial">.&nbsp;
The logo is a rounded box/maze with a stylized &quot;F&quot;
joined with a shape that may be an upside down or backwards
&quot;F.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The logo forming amid the light
effects; flying of the company name.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: '80s special effects</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: An orchestrated tune or the
end of the show's theme</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Was seen on &quot;The
Best of Saturday Night&quot; reruns (60 minute syndicated cut
downs) and on the first season of Cagney and Lacey. However, on
reruns of the latter shown a few years ago on TNN, the Orion
Television logo was plastered over all the 1st season episodes
except 1 (which in turn had the Orion logo right after). Used
until Filmways takeover by Orion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Rhodes Productions</B><br>
</font><font face="Arial">(1971?-1995)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background the
words &quot;Syndication through&quot; appear to the left, then
letter by letter come the words:<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">RHODES</font><font
face="Arial"><br>
</font><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">PRODUCTIONS </font><font
face="Arial"><br>
<br>
Both are in a rounded font, looking quite similar to the Filmways
font on logos 2and 3. Around the right of the logo several white
stars appear.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>A Few Notes</u>:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">On the syndicated edition of the
        original Hollywood Squares, this logo had an on-screen
        appearance, and a Filmways byline was present, but would
        later have the full logo animation on screen.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Rhodes broke apart from Filmways in
        1980, becoming independent.</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The words and stars appearing
gradually to the music<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Simple animation<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: Synthesized notes that ascend, drop, and then
ascend again. The last high note is held for the stars'
appearance.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Seen at the end of the game show Pitfall,
and as a still shot in the end credits of episodes of the
original run of Hollywood Squares. Was also used for the NBC
episodes of SCTV. Was also responsible for off-quality prints of
&quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; and plastered their logo over the
originals.<br>
