<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: This
superimposed logo features three tv tube-like shapes. One is at
the bottom, and the other two are stacked on the left and right
corners of the bottom tube. The company byline appears as &quot;A
Videocraft International Production&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None, it's a
superimposed logo</font> </p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Usually the
outro of a TV show.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Near

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Tri-Colored
V&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Over a white
background, we see two colorized TV tubes aside each other. The
names of the producers pop up on both tubes:</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial">Arthur Rankin, Jr. (in the
red tube on the left)</font><br>
<font color="#400040" face="Arial">Jules Bass (in the blue tube
on the right)</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial">The logo pans outward to
reveal the third tube (which is green) on the bottom, revealing
the infamous &quot;V&quot; design from the previous logo. The
phrase appears as &quot;An Arthur Rankin, Jr.-Jules Bass
Production.&quot; The words &quot;Videocraft International
Limited&quot; appear in black underneath the logo.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The name pop-in;
the pan-out</font> </p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>:
Pretty simple but effective animation.</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Three
ascending notes (the majority of which are produced by a horn)
herald the appearance of the Rankin and Bass credit popping in,
followed by a brief flute melody during the pan-out, and then a
one-note abrupt end. A piano and drum also seem to be part of the
music, and all the while, a set of bongo drums play in the
background.</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>:
Extinct, as far as I know. Seen on &quot;The King Kong Show&quot;,
and possibly &quot;The Cricket from The Hearth&quot; special,
aired in 1967.</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>:
Minimal. The dramatic music might get to some viewers.</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The
Christmas Special Logo&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: The screen is
made up to look like a television set, with a blue border
surrounding a white square with rounded corners that's supposed
to represent a TV monitor. The symbol is a vertical rectangle
with two dots along its right side, and the rectangle and top dot
are dark shades of blue while the bottom dot is a lighter shade (forming
a stylized R-B, you can make out the &quot;r&quot; using the dark
shapes, and add that last dot to make a &quot;B&quot;) To the
logo's music, the symbol forms one shape at a time on the left
side of the &quot;monitor;&quot; the rectangle &quot;slides&quot;
in, then the two dots appear. Alongside that appears the words
&quot;A Rankin-Bass Production.&quot; Sometimes &quot;A Division
of Tomorrow Entertainment Inc.&quot; will appear below the ID.</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Symbols and
words appearing.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>:
Simple animation.</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: The same one
from their &quot;Videocraft&quot; ident. Bongos and all.</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Based
on this past Christmas, we may be seeing the end of this one on
network TV. The CBS reruns of &quot;Rudolph The Red-Nosed
Reindeer&quot; and &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; both received
new closing logos for Golden Books. However, cable reruns of some
holiday specials (particularly on ABC/FOX Family Channel)
retained the R-B ID.</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>:
Minimal. As usual, the dramatic music may unnerve some.</font></p>

Blues&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: The screen
flashes three different shades of blue, with the effect that
they're getting sucked inwards, into a rectangle at the left of
the screen. Every time they go through a shade, that's the color
the rectangle is until all three have been done and the screen is
white. Then the circles appear to complete the stylized &quot;R-B,&quot;
except instead of just appearing they sort of &quot;grow&quot; in
their places. To the right of the logo appear the words &quot;A
Rankin-Bass Production&quot; as usual. It looks like the first
logo without the TV monitor.</font></p>

still appear on some holiday special reruns on ABC Family
Channel, but we won't know until this Christmas.</font></p>

scare some.</font></p>

with the text in light-blue, in the corporate font of then-current
parent company Telepictures. A white line forms under the <br>
logo, and that line &quot;springs&quot; into a cursive &quot;Animated
Entertainment&quot;. Then, the &quot;R-B&quot; zooms up, and the
shapes slide apart as they come closer to the screen, revealing a
white &quot;from&quot;. As the &quot;O&quot; overtakes the
screen, we see the animation of the Telepictures or Lorimar-Telepictures
animation, which eventually fills the entire screen.</font></p>

<p><font color="#400040" face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The &quot;Animated
Entertainment&quot; &quot;spring&quot; effect.</font></p>
