<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial">Time-Life/Lionheart
Television</font> </p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Compiled by James Fabiano,
Daniel Fuentz And Sean Beard</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">Time-Life Television</font><font
face="Arial"><br>
(1971-82)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A few explanatory notes first:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Time-Life Television was a division of Time
Inc. active throughout the Seventies. It was most notable as the
US distributor of the BBC's television output including Doctor
Who and Monty Python's Flying Circus.<br>
<br>
Time Inc. spun it off in 1982 to a HBO/BBC Enterprises joint
venture which renamed it Lionheart Television International. The
BBC eventually bought Lionheart outright by 1987 making it their
North American distribution arm (now called BBC Worldwide
Americas).<br>
<br>
A totally different company operating as Time-Life Television
exists today-as the production unit of Time-Life Video.<br>
<br>
<u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;T-L&quot;, &quot;Time-Life&quot;,
&quot;The Time-Life TV Set&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: A white conjoined, slanted TL (with the L connected
near the end of the T) zooms into place onto a television-like
box with a red/orange screen in the center,trailing itself as it
goes (å la the 1978-81 Filmways logo). Once it reaches the
screen, it quickly flashes and merges with the box forming the
logo. On the bottom of the screen, the phrase &quot;A BBC-TV
Production&quot; is seen as the logo completes its formation.
This is faded out and the &quot;Distributed By TIME-LIFE
TELEVISION&quot; blurb, centered under the logo,takes its place
and then fades out completely.<br>
<br>
<u>FX</u>: The TL trailing onto the empty shell of the logo and
&quot;flashing&quot; into place<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Way off the scale, with the
dawn-of-the-Seventies logo design,EXTREMELY crude animation and
that jingle...! <br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: A shrill Moog synthesizer sounder, which seemingly
grows louder and higher in pitch as the logo forms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Avaliability</u>: Was prevalent
throughout the Seventies on BBC programs shown in the US and
Canada,but mercifully replaced with the various Lionheart
Television or BBC Worldwide logos over the years. [Monty Python's
Flying Circus switched distributors completely, with logos for
Python (Monty) Pictures Ltd. and Devillier-Donegan Enterprises
replacing the Time-Life ID.] Surprisingly, it can still be found
on certain Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker episodes of Doctor Who from
the Seventies, whose 1972-78 vintage prints are still in use
today. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Nightmare-inducing
level, with the jingle and the animation.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">Lionheart Televison</font><font
face="Arial"><br>
1st Logo<br>
(1982-1986)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a plain black background a
crude white drawing of a lion holding a winged staff or torch
zooms up. From the left side of the picture the words &quot;AN
ABC PRODUCTION&quot; fly out. That then flips to reveal:<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Distributed by<br>
LIONHEART<br>
TELEVISION INTERNATIONAL INC.</font><font face="Arial"><br>
<br>
&quot;Lionheart&quot; is in a stylized font.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX/Cheesy Factor</u>: A creepy Moog
synthesizer intro, the &quot;flipping lion&quot;. The
&quot;flipping lion&quot; almost looks like it has its tognue
sticking out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A moog synthesizer tune that
starts with what sounds like a &quot;winning&quot; sound effect
on a slot machine or a video game, which is followed by a
fanfare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Extinct, usually
replaced with the 2nd logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: High, has a very
creepy Moog synth tune and a terrible look. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1986-1989)<br>
<br>
<u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Lion and Stripe,&quot; &quot;The BBC In
America&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: Against a black screen, many white dots
&quot;dissolve&quot; upwards and form a red and white lion's
head. The words &quot;LIONHEART TELEVISION - THE BBC IN
AMERICA&quot; appear from the bottom of the screen while a red
and white stripe is &quot;drawn&quot; under the lion's head.
There is a &quot;V&quot; shaped bend in the stripe at the part
below the head.<br>
<br>
<u>FX</u>: The lion materializing, the stripe being drawn, flying
words.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Simple '80s
animation.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: None.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Can still be seen at the end of &quot;Are
You Being Served?&quot; However, not every episode has it, not by
the usage of the &quot;BBC America Presents&quot; bumper as
previously mentioned. If I remember correctly, it is also at the
end of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; reruns.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Pretty innocuous. No music and simple
animation will probably scare few. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo<br>
(1989-1994)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: A picture of a globe is seen
spinning around while parallelograms with the letters
&quot;BBC&quot; drop over the globe. Under the &quot;BBC&quot;,
the words &quot;Lionheart Television&quot; appear with &quot;A
British Broadcasting Corporation Company&quot; in small letters
underneath.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The /B/B/C/ logo flying into
place on the globe; the remaining text fading into place</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A variant of the fanfare used
in the first logo. Also used the ITC 1986 music on one occasion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Rare, but seen a good
deal on A&amp;E (Lovejoy, A Touch of Frost, Pole To Pole with
Michael Palin) and PBS until the mid-90s; also used to replace
the older Lionheart (and Time-Life) logos on reissued BBC library
shows (i.e. Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbours, 'Allo,'Allo, To The
Manor Born)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None </font></p>
