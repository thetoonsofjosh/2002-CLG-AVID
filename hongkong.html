<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: We first
see a blue-colored 2-dimensional globe of the world rotating
reversely than the way it should, backing away, revealing a field of
stars all moving concurrently (not some moving toward the screen and
others moving in the background), and then at the same time the words
at the bottom say "Copyright HK-TVB International Ltd. 1983," and
then a blue outlined-rectangle (square on top, small rectangle on
bottom), come out, rotating out toward us until it turns upside down,
and as the words I described disappear, the rectangle, now right-side
up, heads toward the spinning globe, and the field of stars changes
to another field of stars, and the rectangle goes up in place. 3
light beams hit the globe, and it explodes, then magically the TVB
logo (blue, green, and red) appears in the square, and "HK-TVB
International," in the rectangle, both in white outlines. The words
"An HK-TVB International Limited Distribution" appears in the bottom,
and the second field of stars stops moving. On some videos these
words will appear in Chinese, since in Hong Kong, the 2 main
languages are Chinese and English. </FONT></P>

a few laser beam sounds, then an electronic synthesizer that starts
low and then gets high, then a few drum beats on the last few notes,
with more laser beam sounds. </FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: We start
with a chromo shot of the words "TVB" and "INTERNATIONAL" going
around a colored 3-dimensional globe rotating the same way as Logo 1,
and then pan out to see both the words and the globe entirely, the
words upside down on a blue background. As soon as the word "TVB"
reaches the center it comes flipping down, until it's right-side up.
At the same time, the blue and red shades come from the right, and
the green from the left covering up the globe. The word
"INTERNATIONAL" comes down too. Then the white part resembled to look
like an antenna-less TV set, the part of the company's current logo,
magically appears. </FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: An few
woodwinds play twice and then a few drums are added in and then they
end on C Major, with a huge drum boom at the end. </FONT></P>

(1996?-) </FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: We see
the right side of a blue-colored 3-dimensional globe rotating the
same way as Logos 1 and 2, with a mirror image of the logo on the
right side. As soon as the Americas vanish, the letters T, V, B, and
I all come around in a straight line in the direction of the globe.
The globe backs away and we can see a mirror image of Europe,
Australia and Asia. The TVBI name comes into the picture from the
front of the screen to the left on a moving blue background, and at
the same time the white TV set outline falls in and the countries
change to the blue-green-red part of the logo. The words "Distributed
by TVBI Company Limited," in both English AND Chinese fall into the
picture. The TVBI name shines with pride and the background stops
moving. </FONT></P>
