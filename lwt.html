<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial">London Weekend
Television</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Written and Compiled by Matt
Williams and Kris Starring</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo<br>
(1968)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black screen, the words
&quot;From London Weekend Television&quot; zoom in from the
center.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The zooming in.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The zooming in looks
like someone is moving it onto the screen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A rather electronic tune
ending with a &quot;pinball noise&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Not widely seen in
America.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: High, the moog
synthesizer and choppy zoom effect will get on nerves. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1969-1971)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a yellow background, 3 rows
of stripes form, the middle white, and the ones to the sides of
it a darker brownish color. They then rotate around, revealing
that it is a circle with an outline of stripes, and &quot;From
London Weekend&quot; in the center.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>B/W Variant</u>: This logo originated in
black and white, with the brownish stripes dark gray and the
background a light gray.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The rotating.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Surprisingly none,
this is a clean animation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A rather highbrow piece with
three bongs at the end (in the b&amp;w logo, there are only two.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Not widely seen in
America.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None, this is a clean
logo. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo<br>
(1971-1978)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;River&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background, a row
of orange, white, and blue stripes moves onto the screen. They
swerve at strategic points, resembling a connected
&quot;LW&quot;, with the W connected to the L by the bottom of
the letter. Above it, the words &quot;London Weekend&quot;
appear.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The appearance of the stripes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Rather rough
animation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A xylophone scale that
climaxes in a full orchestra.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Not widely seen in
America.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: High, the rough
animation combined with the jingle can rattle nerves. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">4th Logo<br>
(1978-1985)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;River 2&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: The same as logo 3, but near
the end of the animation, the &quot;LW&quot; disconnects and
morphs into the letters &quot;LWT&quot;, each made up of the same
stripe pattern. Below it, &quot;London Weekend Television&quot;
appears.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The appearance of the stripes
and the morphing effect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Slightly smoother but
still rough.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: The same as above, only
slightly redone so that the end is a bit more majestic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Again, usually only
seen in Britain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Median, still rough
but the jingle and animation are mellower. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">5th Logo<br>
(1982-1986)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname:</u> &quot;Your Weekend
ITV&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo:</u> On a black background, we see
red, white, and blue 3D stripes coming from the top and bottom of
the screen. We rotate around to find that the stripes are the
diagonal lines going through the &quot;W&quot; in LWT, elongated
and stretching far from the logo. The lines all condense and go
in to place as the LWT rotates to face us, and a sphere with a
design somewhat similar to the 80's New World logo on it rotates
into view. The sphere and LWT stop and the words &quot;Your
Weekend ITV&quot; (ITV being in the form of the 80's ITV print
logo) rotate around coming from the left, &quot;orbiting&quot;
the sphere, and stop at the bottom left corner of the screen. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX:</u> Great early 3D CGI from LWT! Has
to tie with the TSW logo for the best logo of 1982.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor:</u> The cheesy,
&quot;futuristic&quot; synth music does not go with this logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music:</u> Starts out with a futuristic
computer-like synth sound, which culminates into an 80's techno
jingle, and ends in a deep synth bass.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability:</u> Extinct, and only seen
in Britain. LWT used it as an alternative to the
&quot;River&quot; ident for introducing shows out-of-vision (such
as ITN news breaks) and as a break bumper in the early 80's.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor:</u> Median, the dark
nature of the logo combined with the synth music may cause some
scares.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">6th Logo<br>
(1986-1989)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Blinds&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a gray background, the
stripes on the letters &quot;LWT&quot; slowly rotate into view,
forming the letters in the process. The letters are formed one by
one. The orange stripes are now clearly red. A shadow forms when
the logo is completely formed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variant</u>: For local programs, the
entire picture rotates like a pair of venetian blinds to pictures
of the letters separately on the gray background, then to a
picture of all the letters together.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The rotating in of the stripes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: None, great CGI that
holds up even today. LWT was by now famous for good logos.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A triumphant synthesized
theme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Seen mainly in
Britain-ITV abolished pre-show idents like this in 1988 so logos
would become even scarcer from this point on.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, this is an
excellent logo. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">7th Logo<br>
(1989-1991)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;ITV Generic&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background a
&quot;river&quot; of colors is seen. Below it is &quot;LONDON
WEEKEND TELEVISION&quot; in italics and over the river is the LWT
logo. The LWT logo wavers and fades, as one-by-one images of ITV
programs appear. One by one in the river, the letters
&quot;ITV&quot; appear. The &quot;V&quot; is cut in half and a
triangle appears where the other half should be. In the triangle
are stripes in the LWT colors of Red, White, and Blue. The river
fades out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The &quot;River&quot; and the
ghost-like appearances of the images.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The wavering of the
LWT looks rather fake but everything else is clean.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A rather airy synthesized
theme that culminates in a French horn. Composed by David Dundas
as an ITV jingle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Now Extinct, was only
used as a channel id-this was actually a generic ITV logo
modified by the network to feature the LWT logo and the stripes.
Many ITV companies like Thames used a variation of this logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, this is a clean
logo. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">8th Logo<br>
(1991-1996)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background, red
white and blue cubes appear. They then move towards each other,
forming a CGI &quot;LWT&quot; logo. Behind it, several streaks in
red, white, and blue appear. Below the logo sometimes,
&quot;ITV&quot; will appear like in logo 6 but with a blue
triangle with lines cut out of it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The cube effects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Nothing cheesy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A variation of the David
Dundas theme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Again, now extinct.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, a clean logo, and
a warm-up for the next logo LWT used :) </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">9th Logo<br>
(1996-1999)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background, a
&quot;star&quot; of cubes appears, in the LWT colors. The cubes
then zoom away from the star-like shape and then group together
to form a new LWT logo, now redesigned, with the stripes now cut
out of the letters and the LWT being a solid red, white, and blue
respectively. The logo is on a background with smoke.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The cubes forming the new LWT
logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Not cheesy at all-in
fact, this is one of the best animations I personally have seen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A hit followed by a string
section climaxing in a four-note fanfare.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Sadly extinct.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None, A VERY nice logo
with as I noted some EXCELLENT animation! </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">10th Logo<br>
(1999-2000)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;TV From The
Heart&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a blue background with
spinning hearts, the letters &quot;LWT&quot; in a similar style
as logo 8 are in the center. A blue border is around the logo,
and at the bottom of the border in a blue square are the yellow
letters &quot;itv&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variant</u>: A short film culminating in
the appearance of a heart usually precedes this logo. However,
there is a standard animated logo that shows the logo formed by
yellow lines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The spinning hearts</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The spinning hearts
look cheesy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A tense orchestrated fanfare
culminating in a four-note piano fanfare.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Extinct in this
region, but this is one of ITV's generic logos-and as such
appears elsewhere with a different logo(for example: Yorkshire)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None, a clean (and
BORING) logo. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">11th Logo<br>
(2000-2002)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The Video Wall&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: A crowd of people, shown in
silhouette, are watching a red video wall. The camera zooms
towards the wall and then &quot;flashes&quot; to the LWT/ITV logo
like in logo 9, scrunched up and rotated. The logo rotates to its
normal position and we zoom out to see it pictured on the video
wall, with red &quot;static&quot; behind it. The web address, </font><a
href="http://www.g-wizz.net/lwt"><font face="Arial">www.g-wizz.net/lwt</font></a><font
face="Arial"> appears below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variant:</u> Starting in 2001, the ITV
logo at the bottom is replaced with an identical ITV1 logo,
following the name change for the network.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The video wall</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: None, a return to
LWT's strength-good, creative logos.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A rather electronic theme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: No longer current.
This ident was sadly to be LWT's last, as the new branding for
ITV1 as of October 27, 2002 called for a generic, flagship London
region that gave the city no regional identity. The new region is
known offscreen as &quot;ITV1 London&quot; and operates both
weekdays and weekends.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None, in fact,
complaints by viewers that the previous logo was tacky probably
led to this one! Nonetheless, this logo was a fitting end to an
ITV company with a long history of famous logos.</font></p>
