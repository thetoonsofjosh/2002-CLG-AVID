<u>Logo</u>: Aaron Spelling Productions never had a logo. In the
ending credits of shows like &quot;Dynasty&quot; and &quot;Hotel,&quot;
the text in the series type font would appear superimposed at the
end:<br>

But on shows like &quot;The Love Boat,&quot; it would probably
have some optional custom type font variation of the company name
onscreen.<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: None, it's an in-credit logo<br>
<br>

by producer Leonard Goldberg. It would just say:<br>

Then, they would cut to the then current CPT logo afterward.<br>

1st Logo<br>
(1989-1992)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: Just a black screen with &quot;SPELLING
ENTERTAINMENT, INC.&quot; in white, and a stylized &quot;S&quot;
that somewhat resembles the &quot;S From Hell&quot; Screen Gems
logo. This S, however, has three lines going upward, three lines
going down, and a rectangular structure behind it. &quot;SPELLING&quot;
has the largest typeface, and the additional byline is
progressively smaller, and appear below the Spelling name.<br>

zoom-in effect seen on 2nd season episodes of &quot;Beverly
Hills, 90210&quot;<br>
<br>

over.<br>
<br>
</font><u>Availability</u><font color="#00FFFF" face="Arial">:
Uncommon, still seen on reruns of &quot;90210&quot; from the era.<br>

<p><font color="#00FFFF" face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1992-)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: Against a blue background, two lines (one with
streaks; the other with sprocket holes) would roll together; they
would connect with an arch at the right side, resembling the
shape of a magnet. The word &quot;SPELLING&quot; would then slide
from that direction, with the word &quot;Television&quot; inside
the lower line. The S in Spelling is a bit larger than the rest
of the logo, which shines in with &quot;pings.&quot;<br>
<br>
Under it would read one of the following (as they appeared on
screen):<br>
<br>
A UNIT OF BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINMENT (1993-1995)<br>
<br>
A SUBSIDIARY of<br>
SPELLING ENTERTAINMENT GROUP, INC. (1995-1999)<br>
<br>
A PARAMOUNT/VIACOM COMPANY (1999-present)<br>
<br>
The Blockbuster byline was accompanied by the Blockbuster Video
logo, a blue and yellow ticket stub. The Paramount/Viacom byline
is currently featured in the VIACOM &quot;Wigga-Wigga&quot;
typeface. It was in plain Arial font in 1999. Also, the current
byline appears in a laser inscription effect right under the
Spelling logo.<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: The sliding in of the &quot;SPELLING&quot; name. The
animation is a bit simple, but has worked well to maintain with
the changing bylines.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: If you'd been reading these, you'd know by now.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Pretty easy to find, in current use on
&quot;7th Heaven&quot; on the WB Network, can be seen on reruns
of &quot;90210&quot; and &quot;Melrose Place&quot; from this era,
among others.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, most themes playing over this logo are
pretty lush, and the colors work, so it should be OK with most.</font></p>

<br>
<u>Logo</u>: Thomas/Spelling Productions (maintained with Danny
Thomas) had an actual logo... but we do not have any information
on that right now. In the meantime, here's the in-credit
description. In the ending credits of shows like &quot;The Mod
Squad,&quot; the text in the series type font would appear
superimposed at the end:<br>
<br>

closing credits of &quot;The Guns of Will Sonnett&quot;, while
the on-screen version was seen on &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;<br>
