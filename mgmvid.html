(1979-1983)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: On a black background, a diagonal metallic silver
bar zooms out. In unison, a silver &quot;MGM&quot; and a silver
&quot;CBS&quot; slide in on opposite sides of the slash. After
the logo stops zooming out, a green &quot;HOME VIDEO&quot; zooms
out underneath the logo.<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor/SFX</u>: The &quot;glowing&quot; of the letters,
the zoom-out effect.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: A quick orchestral jingle.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Can be found on most MGM/CBS Home Video
releases (including the original releases of &quot;S.O.B.&quot;
and &quot;That's Entertainment! Part II&quot;)<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Medium, the zoom-out effects and music may
scare a few people. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>CBS Video</B></font><font
face="Arial"><br>
(1979-1983)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Background</u>: CBS Video Distributed
MGM's movies from 1979-1983. Their logo appears at the end of
most MGM/CBS Releases.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &lt;/<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: On the top-right corner of a black screen, five
lines are drawn in rays of light, to form a shape resembling the
letters CV, shaped like this: &lt;/. When that is fully formed, a
bar of light forms &quot;CBS&quot; to the left of the logo, then
&quot;VIDEO&quot; is formed below the &quot;CBS&quot; and the
&lt;/ in a similar fashion.<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor/SFX</u>: The &quot;drawing&quot; of the lines,
the &quot;bars of light&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: A longer, slower variation of the MGM/CBS fanfare.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: At the end of most MGM/CBS releases, look at
old mom-and-pop video stores. This was also on early CBS-FOX
releases, with the CBS-Fox music.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Minimal, the music may unnerve some but is
much tamer than MGM/CBS.</font></p>

1st Logo<br>
(1983-1995)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;MGM/UA&quot;,
&quot;MGM Lion&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: On a black screen, the letters &quot;MGM&quot; and
&quot;UA&quot; come from the top-left and bottom-right of the
screen respectively and meet, as a slash is drawn between them.
Meanwhile, a still picture of the MGM lion in the ribboned circle
zooms out from the top. Suddenly, in rays of light, the &quot;ribbons&quot;
on either side of the logo are formed. Then, when the logo is
mostly formed in the middle, &quot;HOME VIDEO&quot; zooms out
from the bottom of the screen and two lines &quot;flash in&quot;,
one above and one below.<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor/SFX</u>: Pretty much the entire formation of the
logo, the shine<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: The longer variation of the MGM/CBS logo heard in
the &lt;/ CBS Video logo.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Seen on most pre-1995 MGM/UA logos but this
logo appeared in print until recently.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: The cheesy formation of the logo and the
fanfare might scare some but the logo is very popular. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1995-1999)<br>
<br>
<u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Rollercoaster Filmstrip&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: In a flash of light, a ribbon of film suddenly zooms
towards the screen and the camera travels along it in a
rollercoaster fashion. Looking down, in the black spaces, we see
the 1930s MGM logo. The camera then suddenly pans out and zooms
away and suddenly we see the current MGM movie logo, complete
with roaring lion and in 3D. It then settles itself at the top of
the screen, with the &quot;Metro Goldwyn Mayer&quot; and &quot;TRADE&quot;
&quot;MARK&quot; texts fading out in flashes of light. Suddenly,
the lion and black space in the circle turn </font><font
color="#808000" face="Arial">gold</font><font face="Arial">. In
blue, the words &quot;</font><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">MGM/UA</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; revolves and, below a </font><font
color="#0000FF" face="Arial">blue</font><font face="Arial"> line,
&quot;</font><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">HOME VIDEO</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; fades in.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Ending</u>: After the movies, a shorter
variation was played. This one had the MGM Lion and ribbons
zooming in at an angle, and then tilting towards the screen as
the &quot;MGM/UA HOME VIDEO&quot; logo simply fades in. The lion
roars throughout and does not turn gold.<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: Zooming ribbon, pan outs<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: Very dramatic brass music changing to very
triumphant at the end; the whole thing sounds extremely majestic,
adding to the &quot;very well done&quot; feeling.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Can be seen on most MGM/UA videos from 1995
to 1999, although the previous logo remained on the packaging.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, only those who don't like roaring lions
should find this unnerving, but this is a well-done, well put-together
logo, probably one of the best Home Video logos ever. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>MGM DVD</B></font><font
face="Arial"><br>
(1997-)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a red oval, a miniature MGM
logo comes up, roaring loudly, and the letters &quot;MGM DVD&quot;
come up one by one from the front of the screen. Then the lion
zooms out and disappears with a bright flash, and MGM DVD centers
on the screen as the red oval fades out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Six notes as the letters come
in, then an orchestral hit at the end.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The lion roars once. As the
logo fades out, the lion's growling can be heard.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Available on most MGM
Home Entertainment DVDs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: High, as this logo is
extremely loud and comes out all of a sudden. </font></p>
