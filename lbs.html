"scans" across the screen, leaving a large blue fused "</FONT><FONT

consisting of an L and an S fused together and a B in the gap between
them, in its trail, in the center of the screen. The "</FONT><FONT

and stops slightly above the direct center of the screen. Under it, a
small white flash appears, leaving behind the words "</FONT><FONT

this:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">LEXINGTON BROADCAST</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">SERVICES COMPANY</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The beam
of light, and the flash revealing the company name.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
As cheesy as you would expect a mid-to-late-70s logo to be.</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
rising synth sound, a bizarre synth tune which accompanies the rising
synth sound, and a synthesized "zap" accompanying the flash. All
three elements of the soundtrack sound like they were made on a Moog
synthesizer.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Extinct. Appeared on the first season of "Inspector Gadget"
(1983-84), and syndicated reruns of "Superfriends," but now no longer
seen on TV.</FONT></P>

logo.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1984-1987)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
background consisting of a light-to-dark violet gradient, a light
blue, curved "LBS" (exactly like the "LBS" in logo 1, but a darker
shade of blue) zooms out while "unfolding." It stops in the center of
the screen. "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">LBS
COMMUNICATIONS, INC.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" "shines" in under the
logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The "LBS"
unfolding, the company name "shining" in.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The background looks primitive, the logo looks like it's plastered
onto the background, and the "shine" effect is only slightly less
cheesy than the rest of the logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
generic synth tune, ending in a single drumbeat.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Extinct, appeared on the second season of "Inspector Gadget"
(1984-85), "Heathcliff and the Catillac Cats," and 1984-87 episodes
of "Tales from the Darkside," but none of those shows are currently
seen on TV.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Low, the effects are no longer scary like in the first logo, and the
music is also not as scary.</FONT></P>

"Slide-In", "Comets and Dots"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A group
of round balls pan to the left of the screen. The "LBS" slides in
from the right of the screen, during which two groups of lights
streak through. The logo makes a stop at the front of the screen, the
company name fades in.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
panning out and sliding in of the logo and background.</FONT></P>

Mystical fanfare.</FONT></P>

between LEXington Broadcast Services and COLumbia to distribute
classic Columbia shows)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
blue background two sets of three red lines come from either side and
merge into one set of three. A blue "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#0000FF">Colex</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" written in cursive
drops down onto the lines and at the bottom a four-pointed star
passes, leaving behind the word "ENTERPRISES."</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX/Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Logo seems to be totally made of '80s computer
effects. The star has a "shadow" effect.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
oversynthesized 9-note tune, two pairs of four ascending notes
(second higher than the last) ends with one last high note and a
"ping" when the star finishes writing out "Enterprises." Sounds like
MIDI music, or something out of an 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment
System game.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: Is extinct as it would most likely be
replaced by other syndicators or later Columbia logos. However, on
Encore's Mystery Channel's print of "The Canterville Ghost" (80s)
this was retained, even after the '92 Columbia.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Non-fans of oversynthesized jingles (like the people who dislike the
Screen Gems logo of 1965-74) may not like this much.</FONT></P>
