<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Against
a black background, numerous rectangles of different blue shades fly
from the top and bottom of the screen and towards the middle, where
they form a blue, horizontally segmented "Telepictures" logo. The
word "CORPORATION" appears at the right below the logo, and all the
words then turn white.</FONT></P>

</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The white "Telepictures" emerges from the
   bottom of the screen followed by many "shadows" (blue in the color
   version), and moving up and "curving" down as if it was a roller
   coaster. When it stops in the middle, the "CORPORATION" appears as
   always.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The name appears as "Telepictures
   Productions" on network television.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
shapes piling and forming the logo, very excellent animation.</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A drum
roll sounds during the formation of the logo. Around the time it
turns white, the theme ends with a "ding" from a triangle. Later, the
drum roll was replaced by a five-note horn fanfare (but keeps the
"ding" at the end)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Has spotted up on reruns of "Mayberry RFD" on Tuner South and "The
New Dick Van Dyke Show" on Good Life TV Network.</FONT></P>

Median, the drumroll and flashing "CORPORATION" might not go well
with everyone.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1993-)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: "The
Circle T", "The T"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
black background a circular logo is coming towards the screen. Its
border is black on the top half and white on the bottom, and the
inside's left half is white and the right black. Inside is a "T," the
left of which is black and right white. In a flash, the logo appears
much closer and with the word "TELEPICTURES" in the center. Another
flash (which results in a white bar as if someone turned off a
television) brings the logo to a median distance, and under
"TELEPICTURES" is "p r o d u c t i o n s" (spaced and in italics as
seen in the example). Under all that is "A Time Warner Entertainment
Company."</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Later Variant</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
A later version exists where the animation is the same, but the end
product looks different. In this variation, the "T Circle" logo is
zoomed up much more (taking about the whole screen), and the
"Telepictures Productions" text seems smaller in proportion than the
original. This is done to create a new byline (in about the some
position as the old logo) inside the "T Circle" stating "An AOL Time
Warner Company." This version looks much more cheesy than the
original, as it appears that the zoomed the "T Circle" more just to
cover up the old byline.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
flashes and the logo "jumping." Pretty cool effects.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The later AOL-era version looks like the logo was zoomed up solely to
get rid of the dated byline. C'mon guys, you can do a little better
than that!</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
"crash-like" sound is heard with "tingles" heard in the background.
Sometimes will just have the end of the show's theme song.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Can be seen on syndicated shows like Jenny Jones and Rosie O'
Donnell, Change of Heart</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Low, but the version with the music may be surprising.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">....just like the original logo, except updated
with a gold font for "Telepictures." "DISTRIBUTION" is in white. The
words in the ball look as if they are being magnified. When the logo
is finished a flash of light appears in the center and spins upward
to dot the "i" in "Telepictures." The entire logo then shines.</FONT>
