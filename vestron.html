<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo<br>
(Early 80s-1987)<br>
<br>
<u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Cheesy V&quot;, &quot;Christmas Lights&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: The screen fills with red and white stripes which
are cut on the sides (downwards) and in the middle (upwards) by
blue laser-like lights. The stripes now form a &quot;V&quot;
shape against a red background. The &quot;V&quot; flashes blue,
then backs up where it is &quot;shadowed&quot; by a lighter
&quot;V&quot; appearing next to it. Four red lights shine in all
but the lower right corner of the original &quot;V,&quot; and the
lower right of the &quot;shadow.&quot; Above the letter, the blue
light spells out &quot;VESTRON&quot; in white letters, and that
shrinks to fit the word &quot;VIDEO&quot; which appears next to
it.<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor/SFX</u>: Very '80s computer animations of the
stripes appearing and forming the &quot;V.&quot; The forming of
&quot;VESTRON VIDEO&quot; looks really cheap. And the lights on
the &quot;V&quot; look like red Christmas lights.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: Synthesized tones you may have heard on many '80s
TV news programs, accompanied by laser zaps and more synthesized
notes.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Vestron video releases of the time. This
includes &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated's Lord of the Rings&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Median, the cheap effects and music might
sound ominous. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1987-1993)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The Red Circle/V&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background, a small
red sphere zooms into view. Zooming towards the red sphere are
several silver lines, forming a silver &quot;V/Triangle&quot; on
the sphere. The sphere settles near the top of the screen.
Zooming in below it are the words &quot;VESTRON VIDEO&quot; in a
futuristic font resembling that used on the title of the 80s
cartoon show &quot;Transformers&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Text Variants</u>: Vestron adapted this
same logo for its movie and television businesses. The only
differences are that &quot;PICTURES&quot; or &quot;TELEVISION&quot;
replaced &quot;VIDEO&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The sphere zooming in, the
lines, and the zoom-in of the letters.</font> <font face="Arial">All
in all, this logo has exceptional animation and looks very
professional.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A chord followed by a few
notes of piano and then finally a French horn-type sounder. They
also had another fanfare later in the fun that did not fit in at
all.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Very hard to find,
though any one of the three variations may show up on TV from
time to time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Very professional,
very clean. Nothing to worry about. </font></p>
