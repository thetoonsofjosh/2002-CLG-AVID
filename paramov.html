the Paramount blue mountain logo are seen. In a unusual font, we see

logo that I have seen.</FONT></P>

wings.</FONT></P>

this logo appears more realistic and features a canyon scenery around
it. The sky is more distant in depth and is very contrast.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Variations</FONT></U><FONT

"</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">A Paramount

replaced by "</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">A Paramount

time, only the word "</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial"

encircling the mountain. "A Gulf+Western Company" appears on the
bottom.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Variations</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: There is a variation that in 1974, the
two stars are clipped away.&nbsp; The mountain looks the same as logo
2's version, but the stars are big.&nbsp; "A Gulf+" slides in from
the left and "+Western Company" from the right slide in and they're
in a different typeface. The script name also had a few variations of
its own. At least two movies featured the then current TV logo
version, and the 1974 logo features the print logo variation, which
remains from this day forward.</FONT></P>

studios at the time, although "Charlotte's Web" had a 13-note horn
fanfare.&nbsp; Other than that, the movie's beginning theme plays
there.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: Is rare, but can still be seen. Among
the movies released in this era were "The Godfather," "Catch 22," "On
a Clear Day You Can See Forever" (with Barbara Streisand),
"Charlotte's Web," "Paint Your Wagon" and "Chinatown" (with Jack
Nicholson).</FONT></P>

forming the familiar logo. The word </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial"

variations of the logo depending on the movie, and of course the
three byline variants, there are two main logo variations of this

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Version 1: For this logo's
   first year, the words "75th Anniversary" appear over the mountain,
   between the Paramount script logo and the Gulf + Western byline.
   "75th" was in gold and "Anniversary" in silver.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Version 2: Starting in
   about 1999, Paramount redid their logo slightly.&nbsp; The same
   basic concept is here, but is reanimated to look nicer.&nbsp; The
   stars are thicker (with golden sides), shinier, and have a nice
   motion blur effect, the star's reflection can now be seen in the
   lake in front of the mountain, and the Paramount script logo now
   shines.&nbsp; These additions are subtle but they make the logo
   seem much less dated.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">SFX</FONT></U><FONT

in, text fading in</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Cheesy
Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: Early Computer
Animation. The scenery looks like it's a model and looks kind of fake
as a result.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Music</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: Usually silent, but occasionally has a
orchestrated fanfare playing throughout the logo. An abridged version
can be heard on various home video releases.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Music
Variations</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">:
Nickelodeon/Paramount films use chimes for the stars to circle the

FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: Plastered on most broadcast and basic
cable telecasts of Paramount movies as well as some of Paramount's
"marquee" titles that have been remastered or restored. However, most
pay cable showings and video releases still have their original
logos. The 1999 revision is more rare, only appearing on movies which
were released in theaters from 1999 to early 2002-- Paramount has
used the original; 1994 Viacom variation in all logo plasterings and
TV movies such as those made for Showtime. Still easy to catch, even
though it's not the current logo anymore.</FONT></P>

Mountain"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: We see a majestic shot of a large
amount of clouds, high over the earth, in space. In the distance,
comet-like objects descend from the sky and as they zoom towards us,
we see that they are the trademark Paramount stars, shooting towards
us. The shot appears to "shimmer" a bit and then we see that we've
been watching a reflection all along-- the stars have been reflected
through the familiar "Paramount" script. It too descends through the
clouds, until we see a familiar mountain coming into view, now on a
majestic sunrise-like background and surrounded by clouds. The stars
zoom in below the script logo, which is now a light bluish color,
twisting and encircling the mountain. The script logo assumes its
position above the mountain peak as the logo is completely formed.
The Viacom byline fades in below the logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Variation</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: During its first year of use, the
words "90th Anniversary" fade in over the logo with the Viacom
byline.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">SFX</FONT></U><FONT

the more majestic and stylized 1940s and 50s Mountains.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Music</FONT></U><FONT

last logo. Unknown if there's a fanfare this time.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: Just emerging. Late 2001 films on
video and DVD already have this logo attached, and as of March 1st,
2002, this logo has been in use in theaters.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT

and it is a suitable successor to Paramount's original CGI
mountain.</FONT></P>
