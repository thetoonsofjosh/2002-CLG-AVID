FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: We see a TV tube-like shape (outlined
in dark gray and filled in black) over a light gray background. There
are a couple of stars shining inside (like stars in the sky) under
the phrase "A Screen Gems, Inc. Production".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: Like the then current Columbia
Pictures logo, we see a lady (Columbia, a representation of the USA)
holding a light torch on top a pedestal with a backdrop of clouds
over her. The torch lady's head is between the words "SCREEN GEMS"
with "A" above it and "Film Presentation" below it. The byline
"Television Subsidiary: Columbia Pictures Corporation" appears below
that.</FONT></P>

</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Music</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: A majestic horn fanfare at the end of
some syndicated programs. Usually, you will hear the ending theme for
whatever slow played over it.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: Can probably still be seen on reruns
of various SG shows of the era, as it would look silly to cover up
the logo as it blends with the ending theme of the show before it. As
silly as it may sound, C-T has edited this logo out of many classic
programs reran on TV Land. So consider this logo rare.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: Median, the old B/W film and scary
drawing might send some chills, but the fanfare has been considered
by many to be overly bombastic and scary. </FONT></P>

(1960-1963)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: Same as the 1955 logo, excluding the
clouds and the additional captions. Only the name "Screen Gems"
remain. There is an announcer who says, "This has been a Screen Gems
Film Presentation/Production from (the Hollywood studios of) Columbia
Pictures".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Update</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: An updated version of sorts can be
seen as the logo for the "Screen Gems Network," the syndicated
package of classic SG or Columbia shows.</FONT></P>

FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: Last seen on reruns of "Hazel",
"Dennis the Menace", "The Naked City" and "Route 66" to name a few.
Surprisingly, this has been edited over with the Boxes of Boredom on
some shows recently.</FONT></P>

(1963-1965)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Nicknames</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: "The Dancing Sticks," "Stars and
Spotlights" (Heaven knows WHY, this is what some people in the
newsgroup rec.arts.animation called the latter)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: A group of animated lines "drop down"
at the right of the black screen to ascending jazz notes as a swarm
of circles scatter near the middle of the left side leaving behind
the words "Screen Gems." (These circles were what one
rec.arts.animation post described as the "spotlights." Now where do
the "stars" come from?) As this happens, the lines shrink somewhat
and spread out, filling the right half and shaking slightly back and
forth. As the logo completes, an announcer says "A Screen Gems
Production (or) Presentation."</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">In Color</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: When broadcast in color, the sticks
are pale rainbow colors and the dots are brighter.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">SFX</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: The lines dropping and
shrinking.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Cheesy

animations. Also, what are the dancing sticks supposed to
represent?</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Music</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: A jazzy score that ascends as the
sticks drop in, and ends with a stinger when the logo
finishes.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: Due to replacement with various newer
logos, both C-T related and syndication, this is a very hard to find
logo. Though some people say you can still see it at the end of some
classic Hanna-Barbera (SG used to syndicate their shows back then)
programs on the Cartoon Network.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: Median, dramatic music and spooky
announcers may make some jumpy. But pretty tame, especially compared
to its successor. </FONT></P>

</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: Two parallelograms come from the top
and bottom of the screen, and the upper one is at a distance while
the lower is closer. They fly towards each other, and the higher
moves forward while the lower backs away. As they do so, they grow in
length and wrap around a space where a dot appears, forming a
stylized "S." Under that the words "SCREEN GEMS" come forward.</FONT>

   Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc." zoomed up below "SCREEN
   GEMS"</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">When shown in Black and
   White, the standard scheme seems to be a light gray screen and
   black S and words. When shown in color, the standard scheme seems
   to be a yellow screen, red S, and black words. The words may or
   may not have actually been red at one time as well. Later on, the
   S and the words were both black, attributed by some to film
   deterioration. However, when the Columbia byline was added,
   everything was changed to a light gray, and that color change
   seemed more natural.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">SFX</FONT></U><FONT

dot, "SCREEN GEMS" zooming.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Cheesy

animation all over.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Music</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: Composed by Eric Siday and Van
Alexander, it is an synthesized tune said to be produced by violins.
It consists of six notes followed by two oversynthesized tones. In
1971, it was shortened so only three notes came before the tones.
This version was also used for the short-lived first Columbia
Pictures Television logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Music
Variant</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: There is a
version of the logo where no music is played. Another version
consists of a static rendition of the logo, which was seen on the
first season of "Police Story" with and without Columbia bylines
respectively. The latter version had the end theme of "Police Story"
playing over the logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: Is pretty much gone due to syndicator
changes over the years, as well as Columbia/Columbia TriStar's
handiwork. However, it was shown in an edited form on Fox Family
reruns of "The Partridge Family" and in a sped-up form without music
on The Hallmark Channel reruns of "Bewitched." HBO's print of
"Brian's Song" (original) had the silent version, played in full. The
logo also currently appears on a daily basis on reruns of "Bewitched"
on Canada's Prime Network, and it can be found on some home videos
and DVDs including the miniseries "QB VII."</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">: Nightmare. Numerous people have very
unfond memories of this logo, mostly due to the creepy theme music.

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
black background, a flash of light forms a blue dot. A series of
ITC-like tops spin around it and form the two lines of the S (the
same as the scary Screen Gems logo of 1965-1974). Under the S appears
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#3399FF">SCREEN GEMS</FONT><FONT

made this a favorite of logo fans who've seen it.<BR>

<BR>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: It
starts out with a rising orchestra, then to an extremely
majestic/inspirational five-note tune coinciding with the animation

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Uncommon, the logo is current, but not many movies
have been released by the company. Sony describes the movie division
as "a haven for a type of film that falls between those currently
released by our highly valued Sony Pictures Classics, and the wide
release movies that are more traditionally developed and released by
Columbia Pictures." First appeared on television when HBO showed
"Arlington Road."<BR>

<BR>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT

to mellow with age. </FONT></P>
