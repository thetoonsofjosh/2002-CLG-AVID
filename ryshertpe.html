<P><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Arial">Background: Majority of these
corporations were supervised by Al Masini through TeleRep, America's
number one representative in total spot billing since 1968. Founded
as a sales representative for Chris Craft Broadcasting and seeking a
limited list of client stations, TeleRep was sold to Cox Broadcasting
in 1972, hence the connection between TPE and Rysher
Entertainment.</FONT></P>

"TPE"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a

left, "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF">P</FONT><FONT

COLOR="#0000FF">E</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" from the right
(80s-style streaks follow these letters). The letters are filled in
blue. Above the letters reads "TELEVISION PROGRAM ENTERPRISES" with
red lines above and below it, and below "A DIVISION OF TELEREP, INC."
with lines in a similar fashion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Arial">(Note: The logo sometimes appeared
without animation, in silence)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: No
music, but the music from the show might play thru to this
one.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Were once seen on episodes of "Star Search" and "Lifestyles of the
Rich And Famous" but TPE distributed shows from this period are
probably updated with Rysher or other logos.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Pretty low, might look a tad primitve (font-wise) but should be
OK</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1989-1993)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: We see a
black background with dozens of stars tingling away. The words
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Rysher
Entertainment</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" fade in on the background in
a silver, generic font. "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">Rysher</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" is on top of

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX/Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT

CGI.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: With a
pindrop sound, we hear a jazzy saxophone tune that sounds styled to
Kenny G.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Seen on "Saved By the Bell" reruns on TBS. It was expected recently
that due to Viacom's recent acquisition of Rysher, the Paramount logo
may show up on Rysher shows. So far, this has not been the
case.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Median, the cheap animation mixed with the dark background and somber
music is not giving this logo a clean slate.</FONT></P>

Buildings"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On the
top half of the screen, there is a picture of a city at what appears
to be sunset. The sun "sets" and stars and the lights in the city
buildings appear, as do the words "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">RYSHER ENTERTAINMENT</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">".
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">RYSHER</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">" is in a large extremely condensed Times New
Roman-style font and "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">ENTERTAINMENT</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" is seen in a
smallish font below it. A comet streaks in the city sky as the
animation finishes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Arial">(Note: This logo was redone for
movies, the notable differences being that the words are now done in
CGI and the city and sky look nicer.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Arial">(Note: Around 1996 or so the words "A
COX COMPANY" appear beneath the logo.)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The sky
fading, the comet</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
mellow horn tune plays, with what sounds like a bird screeching at
the end of the music.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Appearing on syndie reruns of "Saved by the Bell: The College Years",
"Saved by the Bell: The New Class" on USA, and "Nash Bridges".
However, the Paramount logo may show up on former Rysher shows in the
near future, but has not so far. And on "Nash Bridges" reruns, the
Paramount logo proceeds after this logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
None, the music is actually quite soothing.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nicknames</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"OPT", "OPT Rainbow"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
black background, four rainbow-colored lines, one coming from each
side of the screen, come together to form the letters "OPT". The line
from the left curves to form the "O", the lines from the bottom and
the right combine together to form the "P", and the lines from the
top and the right combine together to form the "T". When "OPT" is
formed, the screen moves backward, as the words </FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFCC00">"Operation Prime Time"</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"> (in a rounded yellow font) appear from the right side
and place themselves next to each letter. When everything is in
place, the words </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFCC00">"for
better programming"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> appear in the bottom
right hand corner. At the same time, you can see thin overlapping
circles in the background.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX/Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT

company name appearing from the right.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
patriotic-sounding horn fanfare</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Very rare. Originally appeared at the end of "Solid Gold" and various
other syndicated programs and movies in the 70's and 80's, but it is
still intact at the end of "Yogi's First Christmas" on Cartoon
Network.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Median; the dramatic music, gaudy colors, and rather abrupt animation
may cause some scares.</FONT></P>
