<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">The initials SKG consists of the
founders of DreamWorks... Stephen Speilberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and
David Geffen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">(1994-)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Nicknames</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: "Boy on the Moon", "Fisher Boy"</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: On a dreamy, cloud background, we see
a lake, and a fishing reel cast down, making a puddle in the lake.
Panning up, we see that the reel is coming from a boy, sitting on the
moon (in crescent form), fishing. A letter "D" forms behind the kid,
and the camera begins to move past the kid, revealing the rest of the
word it's part of, "DREAM". Clouds move by, obscuring the rest of the
word, and when they clear, we see the word "DREAMWORKS" zooming out,
with the "D" and the "W" a bit bigger than the rest of the letters,
over a set of clouds. As the logo completes, two lines with "SKG" in
the middle fade in, and the logo takes its place at the bottom of the
screen.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Variations</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: Two, this logo was adapted to make use
of the various mediums this was used in:</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">TV</FONT></U><FONT
   FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: The logo is cut down to only the
   last second or so of the animation, with the logo zooming out,
   this includes the boy on moon in the upper center of the clouds. A
   different, softer horn sounder is used. Seen on "Spin
   City".</FONT>
   
   <LI><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Home
   Video/DVD</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: Same
   logo, with music, but the "SKG" part is edited out in favor of a
   complete line with "HOME ENTERTAINMENT" underneath.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">SFX</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: The kid on the moon, pretty good 2D
animation.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Music</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: This wins the "Carolco Award For Best
Movie Logo Theme". It begins with the plucking of a soft string
instrument, then builds into a stunningly perfect horn fanfare, then
culminating with the guitar again. Very, VERY nice, and very popular
as a result. This logo was composed by John Williams, composer of NBC
News' popular theme, "The Mission", the 1980 arrangement of the Fox
fanfare, and some film called Star Wars.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: On almost every film DreamWorks makes
(I say almost because DreamWorks co-produced Cast Away; however, only
the Fox and ImageMovers logos appear on the film) Sadly, the music is
not used on every film, although it is extensively used on the Home
Entertainment logo, so it isn't a total loss.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: Absolutely none, this is a very
popular logo.</FONT>
