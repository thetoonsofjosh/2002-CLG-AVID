we see a </font><font color="#0099FF" face="Arial">blue</font><font

this globe, a &quot;</font><font color="#0099FF" face="Arial">W</font><font

that it blends with the spherical shape.&nbsp; The radar
continues its path downward, making the company name (with <b>WORLDVISION
</B>ENTERPRISES INC. in the style you see here) appear below the
globe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The globe being drawn, kinda
simple, but decent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Pretty much extinct,
was only seen on early syndie prints of The Mod Squad and Let's
Make A Deal to replace the ABC Films ID.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Minimal, unless tape
hiss gets to you.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1974-1988)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>History</u>: Used on '70s-'80s prints of
old TV shows originally aired on ABC, among others. Also the top
distributor of most Hanna-Barbera TV shows from post-1979 when
Taft acquired Worldvision.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Radar Globe,&quot;
&quot;Radar W,&quot; &quot;Worldvision W Globe&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a </font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Arial">red</font><font face="Arial">
screen, we see a </font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">white</font><font
face="Arial">, radar-like line going upward to slowly form a </font><font

oval-shaped globe with longitude and latitude lines.&nbsp; In the
center of this globe, a &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF"
face="Arial">W</font><font face="Arial">&quot; is seen by
connected filled latitude and longitude squares.&nbsp; The &quot;</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">W</font><font face="Arial">&quot; is
stylized such that it blends with the spherical shape.&nbsp; The
radar continues its path downward, making the company name (which
is in a more plainer font) appear below the globe. Some fine
print appears below the company name from this point onward.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>What's That Print?</u>: The fine print
on the bottom of the later Worldvision logos read: &quot;</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Not affiliated with World Vision
International, a religious and charitable organization.</font><font
face="Arial">&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variations</u>: When Taft Entertainment
acquired Worldvision, these bylines would appear under the
company name:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">1979-1981: </font><font
        color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">A TAFT BROADCASTING COMPANY</font><font
        face="Arial"> </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1981-1987: </font><font
        color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">A TAFT COMPANY</font><font
        face="Arial"> </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX/Cheesy Factor</u>: The globe being
drawn looks pretty simple, but isn't as bad as some logos of the
era.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: This was used
exclusively in distribution, unlike the next logo. But it all
depends on the prints shown on a particular station or cable
outlet. For example, &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and other former
Worldvision shows seen on TV Land have the current Paramount logo.
Other stations may still be using older (pre-1997) Worldvision
prints. A few Dark Shadows episodes do air on the Sci-Fi Channel
with this logo. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Same as 1st Logo</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo<br>
(1989-99)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>History</u>: Used mainly on 1990s prints
of pre-1973 ABC shows, but also applied to the Hanna-Barbera (until
the cartoon studio's sale to Turner Broadcasting), NTA/Republic
Pictures Television (after 1996), Carolco Pictures (the company
distributed their films to TV as part of a syndication package)
and Spelling Entertainment libraries. Also appeared on some first-run
syndicated programs, such as &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and &quot;Pictionary&quot;.<br>
<br>
<u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;WHOOSH Globe,&quot; &quot;90s Worldvision
W Globe&quot;,&quot;Black Radar Globe&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: On a white screen, the Worldvision globe logo from
the first logo with a red &quot;W&quot; comes from the center, as
the camera zooms out,the Worldvision name emerges from the front
and both layer themselves into position as the background fades
to black. The Radar Globe then shines and the &quot;Not
affiliated with World Vision International&#133;&quot; disclaimer-in
much smaller type-fades onto the bottom of the screen.<br>
<br>
<u>Variations</u>: When introduced in 1989,there was no byline
present (like the chyroned version of the previous logo it
replaced). <br>
<br>
After Great American Broadcasting (the former Taft Broadcasting
Co.) sold Worldvision to Spelling Entertainment in 1991, these
bylines would appear:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">1991-94: A UNIT OF SPELLING ENTERTAINMENT
INC. <br>
<br>
1994-96: When Blockbuster Entertainment bought Spelling, their
movie ticket logo appeared below Worldvision's logo (it was
briefly placed next to the globe after the Blockbuster purchase
of Spelling), underneath Spelling's byline (itself having the
&quot;A Blockbuster Entertainment Company&quot; byline underneath
it). <br>
<br>
1996-99: A SUBSIDIARY OF<br>
SPELLING ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC. <br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>:The globe zooming in at warp speed, the layering FX on
the company name, the Radar Globe shining at the end of the
sequence.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: Begins with an annoying WHOOSH and then a 3-note
synthesized tune with &quot;air&quot; plays in the background.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Still commonplace on 1990s prints of many
syndicated shows in all of its variations, despite several series
recieving the Paramount logo in recent years. Also currently
appears on PAX reruns of &quot;Bonanza&quot; (replacing the
Republic Pictures Eagle), FX reruns of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;,
and occasionally on &quot;I Married Joan&quot; reruns on GoodLife
Network.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Median,since this logo can catch a
daydreaming viewer off-guard with the &quot;WHOOSH&quot; and
creepy &quot;w&quot;.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">Worldvision Home Video<br>
(1985-93)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Radar Globe&quot;,&quot;WHOOSH&quot;
(for the 2nd logo)<br>
<br>
<u>History</u>: Primarily distributed videos derived from classic
network television shows aired from the 1960s through early 1990s.
Also issued tapes from the Hanna-Barbera library and a number of
special-interest titles (most notable among these:pro golf legend
Jack Nicklaus' &quot;Golf My Way&quot; series). </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo<br>
(1985-1989)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>:The same Red Radar Globe logo
as seen on television but with a minor variation-the phrase
&quot;HOME VIDEO INC.&quot; replaces &quot;ENTERPRISES,INC.&quot;
here. The logo is otherwise unchanged from its familiar form.<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: The same as explained above.<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: This version seems to be chyroned together
(å la the bylineless 1987-89 version of this logo).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None.<br>
<br>
<u>Avaliability</u>: Extinct-check your video store's stock for
mid-1980s releases from the company.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: About the same for this home video twin of a
familar logo.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo <br>
(1989-93)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: The same as the third
Worldvision logo, but somewhat slower. On a white screen, the
Worldvision globe logo comes from the center, as the camera zooms
out, the Worldvision name emerges from the front, and both
plaster themselves into place. The phrase &quot;Home Video Inc.&quot;
slides in from the Worldvision name, as the background fades to
black. As with its television counterpart, the Radar Globe shines
and the disclaimer (in VERY small type here) fades onto the
bottom of the screen. <br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>:The zoom-out, lettering layering FX, shining Radar
Globe.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>:Starts with an extended WHOOSH and gets a 5-note
synthesized tune with &quot;air&quot; in the background (read:an
extended version of the TV logo's jingle).<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Extinct-seen on most 1986-93 releases of
classic TV shows and feature films from the Worldvision library.
Other notable releases were the Filmation-produced feature film
&quot;Happily Ever After&quot;,&quot;Cujo&quot;(made by Sunn
Classic and Warner Bros.) and &quot;Get Smart&#133;Again!&quot;.
Much of the back catalog (mainly the feature films,TV movies and
some miniseries) was reissued by Republic Pictures Home Video in
the mid-1990s (much of it in EP mode with Worldvision packaging),
so check your video store's backstock.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Median, since this logo can suddenly catch a
viewer off-guard with the &quot;WHOOSH&quot; and especially the
creepy &quot;w,&quot; but is considered more annoying than
anything else. </font></p>
