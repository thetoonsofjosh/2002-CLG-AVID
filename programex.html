</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"The Arrows"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
black background, various glowing purple parallelograms zoom out from
various parts of the screen. As more zoom out, we see that they are
pieces of a 3-dimensional outline of the letters "dfs." As all the
parallelograms zoom out to the top center of the screen, a
3-dimensional outline of a box zooms out, and takes its place in the
top center of the screen, surrounding the "dfs." Once everything is
in place, the black background dissolves to a blue-to-white gradient
background with a pattern of black dots in it. The "dfs" and box are
white, and the area inside the box, surrounding the letters, is blue.
A left-pointing arrow with a large triangular section, the
rectangular section near the top of the triangular section, and the
word "PROGRAM" inside the rectangular section, comes in from the
right side of the screen under the logo. At the same time, a
right-pointing arrow, exactly like the left-pointing arrow, except
with the rectangular section near the bottom of the triangular
section, and "EXCHANGE" in the rectangular section, comes in from the
right side of the screen under the logo. They cross each other, then
stop in a position where the two rectangular sections are stacked
right on top of each other, the logo is stacked right on top of the
rectangular sections, and the triangular sections of the arrows
jutting out of the rectangle which the logo and the rectangular
sections of the arrows have formed.<BR>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
parallelograms zooming out, the arrows moving across the screen.<BR>

<BR>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: The effect of the parallelograms zooming out isn't all
that cheesy, but the effect of the arrows moving across the screen is
incredibly cheesy.<BR>

<BR>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
bizarre synth tune comprised of two separate, continuously rising and
falling synth tunes.<BR>

and Costello Show" on TV Land.</FONT></P>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"The Crossing Arrows/Lines"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
blue background with black lines running through it, we zoom out on
two sets of blue words with silver lines running through them,
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">PROGRAM</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">" and "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">EXCHANGE</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">," and two stylized
silver arrows, which come from different corners of the screen and
all cross paths in an "X" formation before reaching their final areas
of the screen and stopping. We see a small "THE" above the logo and
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">A Division of Saatchi and
Saatchi-DFS, Inc.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" below it. The logo
"shines."<BR>

<BR>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Byline</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: In
later years, the byline appears as "A Division of Saatchi and Saatchi
North America"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX/Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: The entire formation of the logo, the "shine."<BR>

<BR>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
First used a remix of the DFS tune, but would later switch to an
unrelated, lilting dreamy tune.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The first variation can be seen on Rocky and Bullwinkle on Cartoon
Network and Amen on BET, and the second variation can be seen on
Sailor Moon on Cartoon Network and Garfield and Friends on
Nickelodeon.<BR>

<BR>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Median, the animation will only annoy people, but the
original music has been referred to as "eerie," and has even
frightened some.
