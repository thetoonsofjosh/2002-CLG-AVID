<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">: A blue screen appears, and then begins
to shrink into a blue circle (on a black background), taking position
near the top of the screen. The circle then "flashes" and "lightning"
appears on the top-right of the circle. The background turns into a
"spotlight" formation, centered on the circle. Below the logo, the
words "TOUCHSTONE FILMS" fade in.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Cheesy

of the circle, the flash.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Music</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">: A "wind-blowing" sound followed by a
"chime" during the flash part of the animation.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">: Extinct, this was used on the first
Touchstone releases and was quickly replaced with the later logo.
However, this logo can still be seen on releases of the
period.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">: On a black screen, half of a blue
"elongated" circle comes in from the right on the bottom of the
screen, leaving the rest off-screen. The second half follows,
followed by "TOUCHSTONE" and "PICTURES" in smaller letters under the
logo to the left. When the circle is no longer elongated and is now a
regular circle, yellow "electricity" flows across the text until it
reaches the circle. When it reaches the circle, it flashes to reveal
"lightning" on top.</FONT></P>

computer effects. The text "shimmers" twice, and at the end of the
second "shimmer", the circle flashes and the lightning appears on
top.</FONT></P>

with the elongated circle are deleted. The text "TOUCHSTONE
TELEVISION" is aside the blue circle, and the text has the lightning

the lightning appears.</FONT></P>

the collision.</FONT></P>

"Home Improvement".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">: "The Sphinx That Stinks" (courtesy
Kevin Smith)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">: On a black background, a blue moon
glows behind an object, as the glow line increases to reveal the
object as the famous Egyptian sphinx. The light dies down to a circle
behind the logo, as three lines fade in below the logo, and below
them the text "HOLLYWOOD PICTURES".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Variation</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">: There is an earlier version of the
logo, where a box appears around the sphinx logo, with "HOLLYWOOD"
above it and "PICTURES" below. Also adapted for Hollywood Pictures
Home Video, with slightly smoother and cheesier animation and the
presence of "HOME VIDEO".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">SFX</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">: The glowing of the light behind the
sphinx, not much animation .</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Cheesy
Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">: OK, there is a
major problem with this logo. That being that it has nothing to do
with the name of the company! What does a sphinx, a symbol of Egypt,
have to do with a company called "HOLLYWOOD PICTURES"?! It just
defies logic here...</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Music</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">: An orchestral fanfare by Danny Elfman,
composer of the Batman flicks.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">: Disney no longer produces films as
"Hollywood Pictures", but this logo was used for several high-profile
films during the 1990s.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FFFF">: Very unpopular, as the concept is
questionable, the animation line is minimal, and the fanfare is
uninspired. However, it isn't scary.</FONT></P>
