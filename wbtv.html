simple lettering of the WB appears at the upper part and a

found on a tape of the pilot for &quot;Kung Fu&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low,
but the copy of &quot;Kung Fu&quot; that has been circulated has

        originally had the words &quot;Distributed by&quot; over
        the byline &quot;Warner Bros. Television&quot; in the
        early years.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">The syndication logo
        was later referred to as &quot;Warner Bros. Television
        Distribution.&quot;</font> </li>

        shadow mode during the 1980s.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">There is a television
        version resembling the opening movie logo. It was

<p><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial"><u>Variations</u>:</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">First here are the little
differences in the logo, along with dates in which they were used:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">1984-1990: Referred to
        as &quot;A WARNER COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY&quot;</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">1990-1992: Referred to

    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">1992-2001: Referred to
        as &quot;A TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT&quot;</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">February 2001:
        Referred to as &quot;An AOL Time Warner Company&quot;,
        with most letters in lower case.</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">Next, we have a few general
logo variations. First, the network variations, along with dates
in which they were used:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">1984-1995: The WB
        shield appears (including the banner reading &quot;WARNER
        BROS. PICTURES&quot;), with &quot;WARNER BROS. TELEVISION&quot;
        on top, the owner byline at the bottom.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">1994-1997, 1999-January
        2001: The words &quot;WARNER BROS. TELEVISION&quot; is
        removed from above the shield and now appears inside the
        shield banner, and the company byline appears under
        another typeface.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">January-December 1998:
        Same as the standard movie logo at the time, with the
        words &quot;75 Years Entertaining the World&quot; across
        both sides of the WB Shield (reading simply &quot;WARNER
        BROS.&quot; or &quot;WARNER BROS. PICTURES&quot;) and a
        darker background. A wind blowing type of sound was also
        used for this logo.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">Fall 2000-January 2001:
        The logo has a slightly different cloud background, a bit
        better defined. The shield logo has an up to date banner
        inscription, still reading &quot;WARNER BROS. TELEVISION&quot;
        across. The byline (reverted back to its first typeface)
        is higher now, to make room for a small www.warnerbros.com
        below.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">February 2001: The
        logo is now a TV rendition of their current movie logo.
        The background is darker, the shield logo still reads
        &quot;WARNER BROS. TELEVISION&quot; across and the small
        www.warnerbros.com below the byline remains intact.</font>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">Now here are the
syndication variations of the logo, along with dates in which
they were used:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">1984-2000: The WB
        shield appears (including the banner reading &quot;WARNER
        BROS. PICTURES&quot;), with &quot;WARNER BROS. TELEVISION&quot;
        on top, and the word &quot;DISTRIBUTION&quot; below that
        byline.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">1993-2001: The same as
        the previous variation, but this time, the words appear
        as &quot;WARNER BROS. DOMESTIC TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION&quot;,
        the the first three words overlapping the other two.</font>
    </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">1994-1997, 1999-2000:
        Most cable TV shows will have &quot;WARNER BROS. DOMESTIC
        PAY TV, CABLE &amp; NETWORK FEATURES&quot; on top (some
        without music).</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">1994-1996: Some off-network
        shows would have a combo of the logo bylines. It appears
        as &quot;WARNER BROS. TELEVISION&quot; at first, then
        fades to &quot;WARNER BROS. DOMESTIC TELEVISION
        DISTRIBUTION&quot; soon afterward. This logo variant
        still had the words &quot;WARNER BROS. PICTURES&quot; in
        the shield banner.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">1984-1996: The banner
        reads &quot;WARNER BROS. PICTURES&quot;.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">1994-2001: The banner
        reads &quot;WARNER BROS.&quot; on most first-run and non-WB
        shows.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">1996-2000: The banner
        reads &quot;WARNER BROS. TELEVISION&quot; on most off-network
        WB shows.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">1998: Same as the
        standard movie logo at the time, with the words &quot;75
        Years Entertaining the World&quot; across both sides of
        the WB Shield (reading simply &quot;WARNER BROS.&quot; or
        &quot;WARNER BROS. PICTURES&quot;) and a darker
        background. A wind blowing type of sound was also used
        for this logo.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">2000-2001: This logo
        is much like its network TV counterpart, and includes
        either &quot;DISTRIBUTED BY&quot; or &quot;PRODUCED AND
        DISTRIBUTED BY&quot; above the shield logo and a small
        www.warnerbros.com below the byline appears.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">January 29, 2001-March
        2001: This shortest new logo has yet another different
        cloud background. It has a bit better defined WB shield
        logo with an updated banner inscription, like that of the
        Warner Bros. Classic/Television Animation version. The
        words &quot;Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution&quot;
        reappear above the shield logo with the new byline below
        it. The company URL is temporarily removed.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">February 16, 2001 (approx.)-:
        The logo is now a TV rendition of their current movie
        logo. The background is darker, and once again the shield
        logo reads &quot;WARNER BROS. TELEVISION&quot; across.
        Like the Fall 2000 logo, this one includes either &quot;Distributed
        by&quot; or &quot;Produced and Distributed by&quot; above
        the shield logo and the small www.warnerbros.com below
        the byline reappears.</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial"><u>Syndie Voiceovers</u>:
Here is a list of the stars that did the voiceover and the
production company stated for early-mid 90s shows that were
syndicated by Warner Bros. Basically, the spiels are what we have
listed here, but also add &quot;.....and is distributed by Warner
Bros. Domestic Television Distribution&quot; to each of these
parts so you can get the full experience.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">Full House, Dave
        Couiler (as Joey Gladstone): Full House is produced by
        Jeff Franklin Productions with Miller-Boyett Productions
        in association with Lorimar Television (1987-1993
        episodes), Warner Bros. Television (1993-94 eps)</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">Family Matters,
        Reginald VelJohnson (as Carl Winslow): Family Matters is
        a Miller Boyett Production in association with Lorimar
        Television (1989-1993 eps), Warner Bros. Television (1993-94
        eps)</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial">Head of the Class,
        Leslie Bega (Maria Borges): Head of the Class is a Eustis-Elias
        Production in association with Warner Bros. Television</font>

        Production in association with Warner Bros. Television</font>

        on the show, an announcer): <i>Alf </i>is an Alien
        Production</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None in
particular, as the logo was still, very very few WB TV logos had
any sort of animation</font> </p>

<p><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The
Cable-Pay TV logo has a bad fade-in compared to other logos added
more smoothly. Also, the design of the first AOL Time Warner logo
has been considered quite ugly and can be an eyesore to look at,
says viewers.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Usually shown
with the outro of any theme music from its respective TV show. A
7-note loud horn theme with a drum cresendoing throughout was
added in 1994.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Still
appears on various WB TV shows on TNT, TBS, TNN with original (at
the time) company info. The 1998 logo is uncommon, and can be
found on syndicated episodes of &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Two
of A Kind&quot; on Fox Family. The 2000 WB logo is considered
rare, as it has appeared for a short time before Time Warner's
merger with America Online. The first AOL Time Warner logo is
somewhat hard to find as it appeared for quite a short time on
TV's &quot;Extra&quot; and &quot;Access Hollywood.&quot; The
current logo is brand new, so be on the lookout for it on TV.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C083" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None,
unless an uncommon glitch with music or placement shows up.</font></p>
