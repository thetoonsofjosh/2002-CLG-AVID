<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial">Before we begin:</font><br>
<font color="#8080C0" face="Arial">I have conflicting opinions on
how much Artisan has had to do with this company. Their website
has said that they own the Carolco film library-but I've heard
elsewhere that France-based Canal+ owns the library/assets,
something indicated by the presence of a Canal+ copyright on
Artisan's Terminator 2:Ultimate Edition DVD. However, since
Artisan is in charge of releasing Carolco films, and that they
have always had some sort of relationship with the company even
in their Live and IVE days, I'm including it as an Artisan
company.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial">1st Logo</font><br>
<font color="#8080C0" face="Arial">(1982)</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black
background, two diagonal streaks come zooming in from the bottom
left and upper right of the screen, merging together to form the
logo. When the two streaks come to a near-halt, the image flashes
to reveal a multi-curved &quot;C&quot;, with &quot;added depth&quot;
to the upper right of the chrome design. The company name &quot;CAROLCO&quot;
flashes in underneath, as the logo shines.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The streaking
and flashing.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Well,
the streaking and flashing really seems very 1980s. Also, the
shine looks very out of sync, if that is possible.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: This logo
features a synthesized score. This too seems very '80s as well.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: The
only film that we know of as of right now to have this logo was
the first Rambo adventure &quot;First Blood&quot;. Other than
that, it's considered Extremely Rare!</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: All
that flashing has to get to somebody, but otherwise harmless.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial">2nd Logo</font><br>
<font color="#8080C0" face="Arial">(1984-88)</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Space
Streaks&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a dark
space background, a streak comes forward from the screen, zooming
back to form a glowing blue curved &quot;C&quot; design. Another
streak zooms out to form even more curves around the C, and when
the last streak zooms out, the logo flashes and turns into a
chrome 3D design, with &quot;added depth&quot; to the upper left
of the finished C design. &quot;CAROLCO&quot; flashes in
underneath.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The streaking
and flashing.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Well,
the streaking and flashing really seems 80s. Also, the logo seems
really cheap, the chrome effect looks dated and bad, the logo (especially
the text) looks very dark when finished, and at least on &quot;Angel
Heart&quot;, has horrible film quality.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Here's where
it gets iffy. &quot;Rambo: First Blood Part II&quot; and &quot;Angel
Heart: use the popular music based on the First Blood music (that
is subsequently used in logo 2), but &quot;Extreme Prejudice&quot;
is said to use an unrelated, earlier synthesized score.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: The
three movies that are confirmed to use this logo are &quot;Angel
Heart&quot;, &quot;Rambo: First Blood Part II&quot;, and &quot;Extreme
Prejudice&quot;. However, Rambo: FBP2, at least on the current
Artisan tapes, has the second logo plastered on there. Therefore,
look for IVE and Live Home Video releases of these movies
wherever possible.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: All
that flashing has to get to somebody, but otherwise harmless. The
First Blood music doesn't mix well with the logo, however.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial">3rd Logo</font><br>
<font color="#8080C0" face="Arial">(1988-1995)</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Laser
Light&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black
background, a small blue beam draws out arcs in laser. As the
blue laser draws out more, we see blue light illuminating what's
below the blue laser, a 3d maze-like &quot;C&quot; object. As the
blue light completes, the objects rotates towards us to face us.
When the blue laser completes its journey, a white &quot;wind
tunnel&quot; effect occurs, and when it ends, another gray &quot;shadow&quot;
of the C maze is drawn out to the right of the logo. &quot;CAROLCO&quot;
zooms out from the bottom, and shines.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" size="2" face="Arial"><u>Variant</u>:
Carolco Home Video used this logo, but cheaply plastered &quot;HOME
VIDEO&quot; below &quot;CAROLCO&quot; in this logo.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The &quot;laser
light&quot;, pretty good CGI effects-the style and tone is
reminiscent of MGM/UA Communications' logo, which is definitely
not a bad thing.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A suspenseful
string tune following into a loud orchestral sounder. This music
is a variation of the Rambo: First Blood theme composed by Jerry
Goldsmith.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: On
several big-budget blockbusters like &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;,
&quot;Total Recall&quot;, the Rambo movies, and of course,
Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Originally went through TriStar for
releases; this logo is kept on video releases of these movies
while TriStar's logo is cut.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: The
quiet music going loud may get on some nerves, but this is a
favorite.</font></p>

Communications</B></font><br>
<font color="#8080C0" face="Arial">(1980s-1991)</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We see a
picture of an atom, which spins clockwise. The atom zooms in, and
then the picture flashes. Two rings appear, one of them partially
cut at the side. (They also represent the initials &quot;OC&quot;)
The two rings rotate to the left of the screen, where the words
&quot;ORBIS COMMUNICATIONS&quot; slide in from the side of the
rings. &quot;A CAROLCO PICTURES COMPANY&quot; is seen below.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The spinning
atom, bright flash and name slide-in.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A high
synthesized keyboard fanfare, with wind-type sounds in the BG.</font></p>

<p><font color="#8080C0" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Rare.
Appeared on various syndicated programs, including &quot;The
Spiral Zone.&quot; The 1990 &quot;The Joker's Wild&quot; and 1991's
&quot;$100,000 Pryramid&quot; revivals are also sources. But
outside of tape trading, is long gone.</font></p>
