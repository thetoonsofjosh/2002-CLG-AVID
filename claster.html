<p><font face="Arial"><u>Background</u>: Claster Television was
founded as Romper Room,Inc. by Bert and Nancy Claster in 1953.<br>
It was sold to Hasbro in 1969 (who renamed the company for its
founders). It still exists as a full-blown unit of Hasbro today.</font></p>

(Romper Room variation, date?)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: In an orange box with red borders is a jack-in-the-box
(named &quot;Happy Jack&quot;) with a similarly-colored clown
suit and a red derby. He bounces around, then bends towards the
front of the box to place, in Romper <br>
Room font, the words &quot;A Bert Claster Production.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>Background/Romper Room Notes:</u></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">Happy Jack was used as the logo for
        the Romper Room preschool toy line (best-remembered
        products:Mr. Potato Head and Weeblos) in the Sixties and
        Seventies. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The &quot;A Bert Claster Television
        Production&quot; (note the wording) ID was present on the
        various local editions as well (Claster licensed the
        format to 250+ stations over the years on top of
        producing and distributing the national show).</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Romper Room and Friends actually ran
        until 1994 (with an additional 85 episodes taped in 1991).
        The 1981-87 shows remained in circulation until 1991.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">There were three hostesses of the
        syndicated RR:Nancy Claster (1954-64), her daughter Sally
        Claster (1964-81) and Molly McAllister (1981-94)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">CBS offered to pick up the show but
        the Clasters chose instead to syndicate it instead (in
        the manner I explained last night-producing a show for
        national syndication and licensing the format to local
        stations).</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The last locally-produced RR (the Los
        Angeles version on the now-KCAL) ended in 1991.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Claster licensed the format to Anglia
        Television in the mid-Sixties for the British TV version
        (which ran from 1964-78).</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Claster licensed the format under the
        condition that the RR format be strictly adhered to and
        that all RR hosts be sent to Baltimore for a weeklong
        training course (led by &quot;Miss Nancy&quot; herself).</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX/Cheesy Factor</u>: Very simple, 1960s-1970s-style
animation.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: The end theme to Romper Room (&quot;Pop Goes The
Weasel&quot;) <br>
<br>
<u>Availibility</u>: According to TVparty.com, tapes of Romper
Room were erased for next day's episode. So the only place you'd
probably see this logo is if you found someone who taped the
episodes. <br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: High, the drawing of the clown was quite
creepy looking (especially for one that is named Happy Jack!!!!).
The presence of a synthesized version of &quot;Pop Goes The
Weasel&quot; may not help matters. </font></p>

</font><font size="3" face="Arial">(1982 (or 1989)-2000)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;The Spinner&quot;,
&quot;The Propeller&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: We start with a shot of this stylized text on a blue
background:<br>
<br>
Distributed By (small, in white)<br>
(the claster logo) Claster<br>
TELEVISION INCORPORATED (in white)<br>
<br>
The Claster logo is in red with the text in a strange, bold,
italic font. There is a small line going above &quot;laster&quot;.
To the left of &quot;Claster&quot; is a red parallelogram with 3
small, transparent lines inside. Now, to the animation. A white
star moves in a horizontal direction from right-to-left and spins
over all the letters in &quot;Claster&quot; until it reaches the
parellogram symbol and stays in place to spin there.<br>
<br>
There is also a well-known in-credit variation of this logo seen
around the mid-80s. It was seen on &quot;GI Joe&quot; and &quot;Transformers.&quot;
It's appearance is the same as the above, but in white and of
course, no animation. &quot;Distributed By&quot; was above, and
&quot;A Division Of Hasbro Inc.&quot; appears below. There was
also an earlier in-credit variant with just text, in this format:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Distributed by:<br>
CLASTER<br>
TV PRODUCTIONS</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">A Division of Hasbro
Industries</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The spinning star.<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The star looks a bit cheap, but if anything
is cheesy, it would have to be the 1st music used. That music is
quite bizzare and borders on evil. One of the most bizzare synth-creations
since Embassy. Also, what is that parellogram supposed to
represent?<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: 2 different themes were used. The 1st was what was
mentioned eariler in the Cheesy Factor. It was quite similar to
the jingle used for Embassy; a synth fanfare, sounding like
circus music. The 2nd jingle was quite tamer, using an electric
piano bridge.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Rare, should be retained on the Hasbro toy
line-related cartoons (such as G.I. Joe, Transformers, Jem, et al.)
whenever reaired. Don't expect this on Muppet Babies, The
Lionhearts, All Dogs Go To Heaven:The Series (they handled
syndication for MGM Animation), Reboot (US rights licensed from
Alliance Atlantis) or anything else Claster handled distribution
for, though--in those cases it was a distribution logo only.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Moderate for the 1st
music, and low for the 2nd. The font wasn't the easiest to look
at either.</font></p>
