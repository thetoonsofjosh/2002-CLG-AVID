"Airplane Passing Globe"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
cloud-like background, an earth globe rotates. No clouds are visible
on the globe. As the globe rotates, a biplane flies around it, with
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">A UNIVERSAL
PICTURE</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" being wiped in as the biplane
passes the globe.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
This logo just SCREAMS 1920s, as everything is a cheesy model. Still,
you have to give them the effort of trying : )</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
None.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
This is the rarest Universal logo. Can be seen on some early films
still, though.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: "The
Art-Deco Globe"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
stylized glass globe is seen, tilted at an angle. Around the globe,
the words "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">A UNIVERSAL
PICTURE</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" rotate, in a stylized 1930s font.
Stylized five-point stars (ala the stars on the Paramount logo)
surround the globe.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
stars, globe, and rotating letters.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
This has to be cheesier than the first one : ) the stars honestly
look like they're hung from a mobile or something. And the glass
globe and letters look like crap. They did get better later on
though.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Usually
the beginning of the movie's opening theme.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Can be seen on Universal releases of the era, and makes surprise
appearances on "The Sting", "The Brink's Job", and "Dead Men Don't
Wear Plaid".</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1946-1963)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
space background, a model globe (harkening back to logo 1, still no
clouds though), rotates. Superimposed onto the globe are the words
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Universal
International</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">", symbolizing Universal's
merger with International Pictures.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Byline</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Later
on, the credit "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">EDWARD

in the lower-left corner.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
rotating globe.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Well, they got sane with this one. Relatively minimal on the cheesy
scale, though you can tell it's a model globe.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
opening of the movie's theme.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"Zooming Globe"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: We zoom
through space, and several rings start to form. The rotating earth
globe appears in the distance, and as we get closer to it, the word
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#868600">UNIVERSAL</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">" in a bold, planetary font fades in close-up to us and
zooms out to a comfortable distance. When the word and the globe are
in position, "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFF00">AN MCA
COMPANY</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" fades in below it, in a bold
yellow font. Two rings surround the globe.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Variations</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Several renditions of this logo have been discovered. This is going
to get complicated, so let's explain this simply:</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">There are two main variations of this
logo:</FONT><BR>

<U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#3366FF">Widescreen</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Always shown in a letterboxed ratio, the globe appears
to zoom in rather slowly, and the "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#868600">UNIVERSAL</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" text is blurred
when it fades in, becoming clearer as it zooms out. The logo is much
wider than usual, to accommodate the extra space.</FONT><BR>

<U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0066FF">TV Screen</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Always formatted to fit the television screen, the
logo appears to move somewhat faster than the widescreen version. The
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#868600">UNIVERSAL</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">" logo is not blurred, and simply fades in. The logo
most people are familiar with.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now, there are several byline variations. There
are, again, two main ones, used with both logos:</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
   COLOR="#FFFF00">A</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </FONT><FONT
   FACE="Arial" COLOR="#868600">UNIVERSAL</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">

   sandwiched between "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
   COLOR="#FFFF00">A</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" and "</FONT><FONT

   (1963-1972)</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
   COLOR="#FFCC00">AN MCA COMPANY</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">", in a
   yellow blocky font, appearing below the Universal logo text.
   (1973-1990)</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">And several miscellaneous additions:</FONT>
</P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">A credit for Edward Muhl, then-head of
   Universal, can be seen on the lower-left of the first movies to
   feature this logo</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The widescreen version of "Jaws 3" has the
   MCA Company text in a more extended font.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">For their Pay Television division, the Pan
   and Scan variation was used, with the MCA byline moved down a bit,
   and "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFCC00">PAY
   TELEVISION</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" below the Universal
   logo.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
rotating globe zooming in, and "Universal" zooming out.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
This was very advanced for its time, and its longevity is amazing,
especially during the 80s, when computerized logos were making their
debut.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Usually
did not have music, but did occasionally, composed with horns. The
Pay Television version of this logo used the same; and was very
cheesy using a low-budget orchestra.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
It's common as this was never plastered over, and was used for a
total of 27 years, the longest-used logo since the classic era of
movies.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
None.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">5th Logo</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1990-1997)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: "CGI
Globe"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A large
"spark" appears as we view the extreme side of the Universal globe,
still cloudless and in CGI. We move down the globe and see, in golden
letters, the word "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#AAAA00">UNIVERSAL</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">", in a brand new
font, circle the globe. We zoom out and the globe moves to center, as
the word "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#AAAA00">UNIVERSAL</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" straightens
itself out and takes its place across the globe. "</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">AN MCA COMPANY</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">", in white, appears below the logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1990</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Universal was celebrating its 75th Anniversary, and the initial
version of this logo was different from the one used afterwards. It
began with clips of logos 1, 2, and 4, and then segued into the
current logo, as if it were a grand unveiling, or a passing of the
torch. The end logo also had "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#AAAA00">75th Anniversary</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" on top of
the logo, with "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#AAAA00">75</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" in the middle of
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AAAA00">ANNIVERSARY</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">" and written out in script.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
rotating globe and letters.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
majestic orchestral fanfare (a French horn fanfare was played during
the clips of the old logos during the 75th Anniversary logo)</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
It's easy to see, as this was on many recent movies.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">6th Logo</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1997-)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: "CGI
Globe #2", "The Glittering Globe"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
black background, an arc slowly appears and brightens. Lights begin
appearing below the arc and we see that this is another globe,
looking over Europe. We move down as the lights appear all over
Europe, and then Africa. As we begin to zoom out, the letters
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">UNIVERSAL</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">", in a similar font as the last logo but handsomely
redone, rotate to the front of the globe. By this time, the globe is
shining from the back. A small copyright appears at the
bottom-right.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Variations</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
treasure trove. There are a few variations:</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">There is a shorter version of this logo,
   beginning as the "UNIVERSAL" text slides in over the logo, with a
   shortened version of the fanfare. This is usually found at the end
   of documentaries produced for DVD by Universal Home Entertainment,
   with a web address for Universal Home's website.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Starting in 1999, the "</FONT><FONT
   FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFF00">universalstudios.com</FONT><FONT
   FACE="Arial">" web address fades in at the end. By now the
   copyright is gone, moved to the end credits of the movie.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The biggest variation came in November
   2001, when the studio celebrated the 20th Anniversary of E.T. The
   logo animates as normal until the very end, when the "UNIVERSAL"
   text fades out and the silhouette of E.T. and Elliott, on their
   bike, fly across the shining globe. Text appears on the bottom,
   "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">UNIVERSAL STUDIOS
   CELEBRATES E.T. THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">".
   This was used from November 2001 to April 2002-- as of "The
   Scorpion King", the normal logo has been reinstated. Sort of (see
   below).</FONT>
</UL>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
lighting of the globe and the rotation of the letters.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Begins
with a powerful, majestic horn fanfare, followed by two orchestra
hits. Then, another horn fanfare, followed by two more hits. Then, a
very majestic fanfare as the logo is completed. Composed by Jerry
Goldsmith, who composed the music for the Carolco logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music Variations</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: From November 2001 to April 2002, the music was
changed to go with the customized E.T. logo-- there is only one horn
fanfare/hits sequence, followed by the end fanfare. This then segues
into the theme from E.T. as he and Elliot fly across the globe. When
the E.T. logo was dropped in April 2002, the music did not change
back to the 1997 version: instead, it's a reorchestration of the 1997
fanfare. Same melody, but like the E.T. logo, it is in a different
key and sounds more "powerful".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
It's Universal's current logo. This logo precedes classic releases on
video and occasionally on cable channels (don't worry, the original
logos still remain)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
None.</FONT></P>
