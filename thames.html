an oval frame, a group of buildings meant to represent London quickly
rises up from the middle of the screen. In the bottom half, another
set of buildings rise upside down, giving the effect of a reflection.
The word "THAMES" appears in both images, then disappears from the
reflection, leaving the right side up word. This logo was in black
and white. At first, only London got this logo. Everyone else got a
plain black screen with the words "FROM THAMES."<BR>

"Rising Building," "Building Out of the Water," "The Benny Hill
Logo"<BR>

<BR>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
color version of Logo #1, now has a sky background and looks more
like a reflection in the water. Slight changes in definition of the
image and such were made over the years, but this is basically how
the logo went.<BR>

<BR>

There have been a few variations on this logo. First, there were the
closing versions, which would be the usual logo with a phrase such as
"From Thames" or "From Thames in Colour." In 1973 the closing message
was changed to "Thames Colour Presentation." In 1980 there was a
"nighttime" version of the logo, with darkened buildings and a night
sky. Another was a Christmas version from Teddington in Middlesex,
where Thames studios were in use. It read "Merry Christmas - THAMES -
Teddington."<BR>

<BR>

"The Kenny Everett Video Show" had a funny variation, as Kenny would
actually burst through the logo, which ripped like paper. Kenny was
also responsible for an "adult" version of the logo, which replaced
the buildings with a certain part of the female anatomy.<BR>

<BR>

In 1982 Thames added a new closing logo withouth the reflections for
its Channel Four programs. Against a black background was a box with
a blue/white outline of the buildings and the word "THAMES" in that.
Underneath were the words "A Thames Television Production for Channel
Four."<BR>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
It looked like someone was holding the picture against a mirror and
sliding it up. Actually this wasn't far from the truth, according to
the Thames Logo Parade website:<BR>

The animated ident was created just as you would imagine. The top
half of the image was laid flat and filmed from above. A sheet of
foil was used to provide the reflection and was at a slight angle
from the perpendicular (hence the tall vertical structures bend in
towards St. Paul's dome in the reflection for a more realistic
effect). Using stop-frame animation, &yacute; la Wallace &amp;
Gromit, produces the appearance of movement. The skyline image didn't
have the letters on it. The letters were filmed separately using the
same process and then the negatives from both films were married
together to produce the final effect. Treating the letters separately
allowed for the reflected letters to be faded out. The Thames skyline
ident was designed by Minale Tattersfield.<BR>

<BR>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
loud 8-note horn fanfare. The Kenny Everett show added an extended
tune to the end of the usual.<BR>

(1989-????)<BR>

<BR>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Against a black background a triangular shape rises from the middle
of the screen. As it reveals itself, it looks kind of like an upside
down Christmas tree shape (2 triangles joined together), and the
upper triangle has a picture of a building against a blue sky. The
lower one is gold color and contains the words "THAMES XXI." As the
logo rises, it too has a reflection, though it doesn't last when it's
completely formed.<BR>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Looks
more modern than before. "Rising shape"<BR>

the words "THAMES TELEVISION." Then the logo disappears and images of
what seem to be program clips pass by as the ITV logo forms letter by
letter. The V contains a triangle with the Thames building.<BR>

camera goes through a three-dimensional image of London. As it pans
away, one of the buildings "fade" into the ID. It's now on top of a
