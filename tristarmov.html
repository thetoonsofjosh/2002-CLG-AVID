<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo<br>
(1982-1992)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Wobbly Wings,&quot;
&quot;Jumping Pegasus&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a blue sky background, a
white horse slowly gallops into view. As he gallops towards the
camera, a pair of wings grows from its body, revealing it to be a
pegasus. When it gets really close to the camera, 3 stars come
from the left, right, and bottom of the screen towards each
other, forming a &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">T</font><font
face="Arial">&quot;. The pegasus then leaps over the </font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">T</font><font face="Arial">, and
flies out of view. The &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF"
face="Arial">T</font><font face="Arial">&quot; zooms out,
revealing that it is the first letter of the word &quot;</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">TRI</font><font face="Arial">&quot;,
with &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">STAR</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; below it. As the words zoom out, a </font><font
color="#808040" face="Arial">golden triangle</font><font
face="Arial"> zooms out, &quot;sealing&quot; the letters and
revealing a black background behind it. As the triangle and
letters zoom out more, &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF"
face="Arial">PICTURES</font><font face="Arial">&quot; is seen
below the logo, and a drawing of a pegasus is seen near the top,
in white. When the logo is completely formed, it looks like the
pegasus is &quot;leaping&quot; over the triangle.<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: The wings growing on the horse, the forming of the T.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The forming of the T
and the zooming out stuff looks kinda dated now, but it was state
of the art then. The main cheapness of the logo, though, were
those wings. The whole thing looks perfectly fine until the wings
start growing. And the wings-they're animated, and VERY cheaply
at that. They look painted on, and they &quot;wobble&quot;. I
know CGI was a luxury then, but man, this is *bad* even for then.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: As the horse gallops into view, three low notes are
played, and repeat. But when the Pegasus flies over the T, more
enlightening trumpets are played and combine with the trombones
for the logo formation. A loud, 3-note trumpet solo is heard at
the end.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: The sudden loud music
might get to some, but it's generally all right. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1993-)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We see a picture of a dreamy,
sun-lit area full of clouds.&nbsp; A bright light flashes from
the bottom center of the screen to reveal a white,
winged&nbsp;pegasus walking on the clouds. In bold,&nbsp;golden
lettering, &quot;</font><font color="#808000" size="5"
face="Arial"><strong>T</strong></font><font color="#808000"
size="4" face="Arial"><strong>RI</strong></font><font
color="#808000" size="5" face="Arial"><strong>S</strong></font><font
color="#808000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>TAR</strong></font><font
face="Arial">&quot; appears on the top of the screen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Byline</u>:&nbsp;Referred to as &quot;</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">A Sony Pictures Entertainment
Company</font><font face="Arial">&quot; starting in 1995.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The light beam forming the
pegasus.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: On the era of the
Sony byline, the bylining looks very cheaply chyroned in.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A majestic orchestral tune is
heard, a remix of the old theme.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music Variation</u>: The theme from the
original logo was used in the early days of the logo.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Is in current use, but not as prolific as
years past.&nbsp; Can also be found on home video.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Screen Gems Pictures</b></font><font
face="Arial"><br>
(1999-)<br>
<br>
<u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;S From Heaven&quot;, &quot;The Spiral S
(from Heaven)&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background, a flash
of light forms a blue dot. A series of ITC-like tops spin around
it and form the two lines of the S (the same as the scary Screen
Gems logo of 1965-1974). Under the S appears &quot;</font><font
color="#3399FF" face="Arial">SCREEN GEMS</font><font face="Arial">,&quot;
and underneath that, &quot;</font><font color="#3366FF" size="2"
face="Arial">A SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY</font><font
face="Arial">.&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>SFX</u>: The flash and the spinning &quot;tops.&quot; The
stunning animation of the logo has made this a favorite of logo
fans who've seen it.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: It starts out with a rising orchestra, then to an
extremely majestic/inspirational five-note tune coinciding with
the animation and the forming of the words &quot;SCREEN
GEMS&quot;.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: Uncommon, the logo is current, but not many
movies have been released by the company. Sony describes the
movie division as &quot;a haven for a type of film that falls
between those currently released by our highly valued Sony
Pictures Classics, and the wide release movies that are more
traditionally developed and released by Columbia Pictures.&quot;
First appeared on television when HBO showed </font><em>Arlington
Road</em><font face="Arial">.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, unlike the television version. The
&quot;S&quot; has seemed to mellow with age. </font></p>
