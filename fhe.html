<FONT FACE="Arial">(1982-1986)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nicknames</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"Soda Pop", "Cheesy FHE"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
black background filled with dots/"stars" (obviously this is supposed
to symbolize space), a large "sun" slowly moves towards us. It then
dissolves into the words "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#800080">FAMILY HOME</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00FF00">ENTERTAINMENT</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">"
in probably one of the ugliest fonts ever. The logos then flash and
become pure white. After a few seconds the logo dissolves and we are
left with only a shot of the stars before we fade out.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
transformation of the star into "FAMILY HOME ENTERTAINMENT"</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
This one goes off the charts. The "sun" looks like the fakest thing
in the world (and looks more like a fizzing Alka-Seltzer tablet than
anything else!), the colors are gaudy, and the space background looks
like it was done on an Apple II.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music/Sound FX</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: The space background has plopping/fizz noises. When
the logo forms a chord/whoosh sound can be heard.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Can be seen on early Gumby releases by FHE.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Median, (the bad animation can get to some people) :) but the logo is
probably one of the most soda-like in the world!</FONT></P>

"F.H.E.", "Handwriting Pad"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFF00">yellow</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"> screen "flips" in, and it has one of those lines you
used to practice printing letters on in kindergarten. (Two solid
lines with a segmented line in the middle) One at a time, the letters
"f.h.e." are drawn on the lines in a crayon-like font. They are
colored, in order, </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FF0000">red</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">, </FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF">blue</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">, and
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFF00">yellow</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">, respectively. Under that the words "Family Home
Entertainment" appear, and then the picture flies away
downward.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"Flipping" screen, drawn letters.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The screen "flipping" is an '80s SFX standard.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Starts
with a zipping sound (kind of like a Jetsons flying car starting),
and leads into a synthesized theme with three different tones for the
drawing of each letter. Three faster tones bring forth the periods
after each initial, and an xylophone is used when the company's name
appears. At the end, a "WHOOSH" is heard as the screen "flies"
away.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Can be seen in early releases of home video releases of shows such as
"The Transformers," "G.I. Joe," and "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles."</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1993-1999)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: "The
Paintbrush"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
white background, a red paintbrush draws an "f" similar to the one in
the second logo then puts a red dot after it. A blue paintbrush
similarly draws an "h" and a blue dot and a yellow paintbrush gets
the "e" and its dot. The camera pans to each letter as it is drawn
and then pulls out. Above the logo the paintbrushes "wash" on the
words "Family Home Entertainment", with each word in red, blue, and
yellow respectively.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Impressive use of CGI from FHE, using the ability to pan in and out
impressively.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music/Sound FX</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Each letter has its own little tune culminating in a
synthesized stinger at the end.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Can be seen on later Turtles releases by FHE.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
None, very good CGI.</FONT></P>
