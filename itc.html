<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>INDEPENDENT TELEVISION COMPANY</B></font><font
face="Arial"><br>
(1959-1973)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The Compass&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a gray background, a
compass appears. It zooms up really close, and then &quot;flips&quot;
to reveal a black diamond-like shape. A map of the world is wiped
into the diamond, as a white outline appears. The diamond's
interior once again turns black as it zooms out, background going
to black. When it reaches the top, a line is drawn through the
middle as an &quot;I&quot; appears in the middle as well. Two
more diamonds appear below the &quot;I&quot; diamond, reading
&quot;T&quot; and &quot;C&quot;, and appearing as the line &quot;connects&quot;
them. The word &quot;presents&quot; appears below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variations</u>: Sometimes &quot;Distribution&quot;
replaces &quot;presents,&quot; and something, there is no text
under the logo. Also, in the color version of the logo, the
background is red, and turns to green during the map part, the
compass is silver, and the map's continents are green.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The compass, the map appearing,
lots of animation in this logo</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: It appears kind of
rough in some spots (i.e., where the letters appear)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A bombastic brass score.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Most likely extinct,
as it hasn't been seen anywhere in ages.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Most likely high, not
seen widely in America if all, but the music would be likely to
set off some people. However, the logo would get much worse in
its next incarnation. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>ITC ENTERTAINMENT</B></font><font
face="Arial"><br>
(1973-1977 logo to be described soon)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">(1977-1987)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Rainbow Top,&quot;
&quot;Rainbow Diamond Top&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a dark blue space
background, three diamonds appear, red, green, and blue
respectively, &quot;interlocked&quot; within each other and
spinning around like a top. From the center of the screen, the
ITC logo, designed much like last time but now turned on its
side, zooms out and quickly moves to the left side, as the word
&quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">ENTERTAINMENT</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; appears alongside. At the end of the logo,
the ITC logo fades out to make room for the word &quot;</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Presents</font><font face="Arial">&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Arial">(Note: On &quot;Space: 1999,&quot;
a version of the animated logo is seen at the end of the program,
with &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Arial">From</font><font
size="1" face="Arial">&quot; to the left of the ITC logo, and no
&quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Arial">Presents</font><font
size="1" face="Arial">.&quot; On all other ITC programs of the
era, a still logo appears in the show's end credits. This still
in-credits logo has either no byline, an ATV byline, or an ACC [Associated
Communications Corporation] byline.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The spinning diamond thingie,
the zooming out of ITC</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The zoom-out is
rough, and the diamond thing is really hard to decipher a meaning
from.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: The same as in the previous
logo</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Not sure, the ITC
library is now in the hands of Carlton Television, a company not
known for preserving logos or even other corporate identities (it
renamed two of its UK Television Stations, Central [the former
ATV] and Westcountry into Carlton last year), and some shows
which had the logo have been updated with the third ITC logo or
other company logos (for instance, The Muppet Show, originally
ITC, has had Henson logos plastered over the in-credits ITC logo
recently)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Nightmare, probably
about as scary as you can get without causing fatal injury. This
logo, even though it is not talked about as much as the other
well-known scary logos (such as the S From Hell and V Of Doom),
is probably one of the scariest logos ever made, thanks to &quot;in-your-face&quot;
animation, a dark mood, and that MUSIC. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>ITC ENTERTAINMENT GROUP</B></font><font
face="Arial"><br>
(1989-1997)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Gold Top,&quot;
&quot;Gold Diamonds&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background, we see
three gold interlocked diamonds, the Logo 2 ITC diamonds but with
no letters in them, spinning around. As they spin around, the
letters &quot;</font><font color="#CC9900" face="Arial">ITC</font><font
face="Arial">&quot;, in gold, slide out from under it, one-by-one,
and then shine, as the diamonds stop spinning.</font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Arial">(Note: There is a variation of the
logo that appears at the end of some CBS Theatrical Films
releases when they are shown on television. In it, the logo is
sped up, the three notes accompanying the ITC letters sliding out
are not heard, the letters do not shine, there is no shimmering
sound heard, &quot;</font><font color="#CC9900" size="1"
face="Arial">Entertainment Group</font><font size="1"
face="Arial">&quot; appears under &quot;</font><font
color="#CC9900" size="1" face="Arial">ITC</font><font size="1"
face="Arial">&quot; once the diamonds stop spinning, and a
different &quot;THUD!&quot; sound is heard at the end.)</font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Arial">(Note: There is a version seen on
British ITC video releases which is the same as the normal logo,
except that &quot;</font><font color="#CC9900" size="1"
face="Arial">Home Video</font><font size="1" face="Arial">&quot;
is wiped in under &quot;</font><font color="#CC9900" size="1"
face="Arial">ITC</font><font size="1" face="Arial">&quot; at the
end)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The spinning diamond and
sliding letters, pretty good animation</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A three-note synth tune,
corresponding to the sliding out of the letters, a shimmering
sound, accompanying the letters shining, and a &quot;THUD!&quot;
synth sound.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Can be seen on a
number of movies on the Encore movie channel-- however, ITC-produced
movies have been showing up on video under the Carlton name, so
this logo may vanish soon...</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None, much more
mellower than the previous logos. </font></p>
