(but we don't know why; the mountain doesn't rise)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: On a blue background, we see a black
mountain and the words "A Gulf+Western Company" in white. Suddenly, a
white filled-in circle border rises up behind the mountain.&nbsp; The
"</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">Paramount</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">" name, which is written in its majestic script font
and appears in black, pops in while 22 white stars appear around the
border, starting in the middle and going downward. The word
"</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">Paramount</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">" immediately changes into "</FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Paramount Television</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">" in the same typeface.&nbsp; Below the
logo are two subtitles, both in white: "Copyright &copy; MCMLXVIII by
Paramount Pictures Corporation.&nbsp; All Rights Reserved" in a more
standard type, and "</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">Paramount Pictures Corporation</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">" in the Paramount logo font.</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Variant</FONT></U><FONT

appears with the copyright, but without the Gulf+Western
byline.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">SFX/Cheesy
Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: The "sunrise"
effect, the stars, and "Paramount" changing into "Paramount
Television" looks very choppy.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Music</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: Same as the Desilu music used from
September-December 1967.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: Very rare, can be seen on early 1968
episodes of </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Mission:
Impossible</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF"> when FX
reruns them, and on videocassettes of </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial"

episodes of </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">The Lucy

logo, but both this and the Viacom "V of Doom," which appeared after
the logo in syndication, have been edited over with the current
Paramount logo by now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Besides the last line, all are
in a blocky font. "PARAMOUNT" has the largest typeface, and the other
two lines are progressively smaller. On the smaller right side of the
rectangle is a Paramount logo with a blue border and white mountain.
The picture zooms up to the logo, which kind of looks like a blue and
white version of the "Rising Circle" ("A Gulf+Western Company" and
copyright message appears at the bottom of the white mountain) except
the word "Television" is not present. Also, the copyright appears
when the pic zooms up.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT

fast-paced to go with the zooming in the next logo.</FONT></P>

FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: There were two themes for this logo.
The first is an 8-note horn-driven jingle written by Dominic
Frontiere, best known as the "Closet Killer." The other is a faster
version of what will later be known as the "Blue Mountain" music by
Lalo Schifrin. Both had at least two versions.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Music
Variations</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: The Dominic
Frontiere jingle is sometimes faster.&nbsp; Notes 4-7 are
louder.&nbsp; Was later switched in 1970 to an 8-note sped-up horn
fanfare composed by Schifrin. Lalo Schifrin's jingle went slower in
the mid 70s, which was ALSO redone for the "Blue Mountain"
logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: Scarce. Has been seen quite a few
times on cable reruns a few years back (i.e.: </FONT><I><FONT

logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: Median, this logo is generally well
liked, but the fast music and scary mountain drawing may get on some
nerves. Also, many can't stand the Lalo Schifrin jingle combined with
the zoom in, although it's a nightmare with the Dominic Frontiere
music.</FONT></P>

navy blue backdrop and a flat mountain in another shade of blue with
the word "Paramount" in white above it. Below the mountain are the

   film clip roll as usual, what they do is show the still of the
   logo with just Paramount showing. Then they allow "Television" to
   slide on in, and the it reverts back to a still image. This can be
