<FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Walt Disney Company never used a
proper logo until 1985, instead using an in-credit caption on most of
its films. However, their distribution arm, Buena Vista, used a logo
in some form until about 1981. This section will chronicle both logo
sets.</FONT>

(1954-1981)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After Walt Disney broke off his
distribution deal with RKO Radio Pictures, he formed his own
distribution company. It is named after the street on which Disney
Studios reside.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
blue/black gradient background, we see the words "</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080FF">DISTRIBUTED BY BUENA VISTA DISTRIBUTION
CO.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" in light blue, with "Buena Vista" in a
weird signature-like logo font, and the other words in a font that
lookes like carved wood.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Variations</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
This logo was redone in the late 1960s, brightening up the background
to a blue/white gradient and changing the letters to a turquise
color. Also, the font for the "DISTRIBUTED BY" text would change into
a more normal font.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">After this logo ended, the words "WALT DISNEY
PRODUCTIONS PRESENTS", in a plain font and often as part of the
credits, would fade in over the picture. Again, Disney did not gain
its own logo until 1985.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: None,
this is a still logo</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The logo looked quite ugly.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Often,
a customized fanfare composed just for that movie, to play over the
logo. Was also seen silent.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
While Disney may be inept with... well, all other aspects of its
business, they're still pretty keen on keeping logos preserved. This
logo was cut on video releases between 1985 and 1991, but is now
preserved on most Disney features from this era, and sometimes also
replaces the still RKO logo used on very early Disney flicks.</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Varies on a case-to-case basis. A movie with no fanfare wouldn't be
scary, but when it's a loud, powerful fanfare (such as on "Bedknobs
and Broomsticks") it might scare some.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">2nd Logo<BR>

(1981-1982)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nicknames</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"The Sparkles", "Zooms"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
black bg, a blurry object zooms out. When it fully sharpens, it is
revealed to be the words "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">DISTRIBUTED BY BUENA VISTA DISTRIBUTION
CO.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">", with "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">BUENA VISTA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" in a taller,
bolder font. The words sparkle, and then fade out to be replaced by
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">WALT DISNEY
PRODUCTIONS</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">". The words then blur up again
and zoom in towards us.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
zooming, the "sparkles"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: "Pings"
timed to go with the sparkling of the words, "whoosh " noises that
sound during the zooms, and a thud noise just before the "WALT DISNEY
PRODUCTIONS" logo zooms in.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
An oddity; this can only be seen on "Condorman", but may be on other
Disney films of the era. "Tron" contains a variation that does not
incorporate any animation. </FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
That "thud" noise and the whooshing may get to some ppl, but it's
basically harmless. </FONT></P>

just text reading "WALT DISNEY PICTURES", but applied differently

box. Any other examples?</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nicknames</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"The Castle", "Magic Kingdom", "Disney"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A shower
of light descends from the top of the screen, forming a stylized,
segmented castle. The segments seem to be spaced farther apart by the
time the light reaches the bottom. Through the main gate of the
castle, white ball of light forms, then extends out to form the words
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">WALT DISNEY</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">" in the familiar corporate "Disney" logo font. The word
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">PICTURES</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">" fades in derneath, and a white circular line is drawn
over the castle.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Variations</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
There is a variation of this logo where the animation is slower and
not as smooth, and the "shower of light" is not as apparent (it looks
more like somebody sliding a sheet of blue paper down to form the
castle logo). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also, depending on the film, the logo is
altered to fit the film somehow. Here are some examples:</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">"Inspector Gadget": The logo is altered to
   look more mechanized, and the white curved line is replaced by a
   gear.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">"Tarzan": After the "flash" that forms the
   Disney logo text, the background fades to that of a jungle.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">"Bedknobs and Broomsticks (longer
   version):" The 1997 laserdisc of this film ends with a short logo,
   but with a black background! (This is not on the current DVD of
   the film, which has the short logo at the end with the normal blue
   background).</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also, Pixar films have their own custom logo,
which is detailed below.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
"glowing castle", the "flash ", the drawing of the line</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The "flash" and reveal of the castle are rather outdated.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
rendition of "When You Wish Upon A Star" finishing off with a weird
nstrument at the very end. Recently, the theme of the movie has begun
over this logo, as the music has become quite outdated.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
We've all seen this logo somewhere, as Disney films are among the
most-watched in the world.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The outdated music will scare a few; otherwise, harmless. </FONT>

(1995-)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: "The
Pixar Castle"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
blue bg, the camera flies out underneath a handsomely rendered Magic
Kingdom Castle, with flags waving about on the top. When the logo
zooms out , the logo proceeds as normal, but the "Walt Disney" text
is rendered somewhat.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Very nice
CGI from Pixar! </FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The Toy
Story films use a bombastic/majestic fanfare, not sure about "A Bug's
Life". The logo as seen at the end of Toy Story 1 has no music, only
flapping flags and a chime noise as the line is drawn.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Seen on all Disney/Pixar productions, namely "A Bug's Life", the Toy
Story films, and the "Monsters, Inc". line</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
None, this is a great logo. </FONT></P>
