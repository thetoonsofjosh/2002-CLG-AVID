(1983-1985)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;RCA/Columbia&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black bg, a white-bordered
box appears. In it are two black rounded rectangles, with the
first bearing the &quot;</font><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">RCA</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; logo in red, and the second having the
Columbia Pictures print logo in a semicircle-like border with
&quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Columbia Pictures</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; below. &quot;HOME VIDEO&quot; is at the
bottom of the white border, in black.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variation</u>: The RCA and Columbia
logos fade in on a black bg, then the white border &quot;swings
in&quot; to surround it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The &quot;swinging border&quot;
on the first variation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Videos from this
company have long been out of print, with most videos being re-released
by Columbia-Tristar(some in RCA/Columbia-style packaging!)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;The Cube&quot;,
&quot;The Spinning Cube&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black bg, we see a
rotating cube, featuring the same logo as stated above on each
side. The main difference to the logo, however, is that the
border is now silvery, with &quot;</font><font color="#C0C0C0"
face="Arial">HOME VIDEO</font><font face="Arial">&quot; in light
gray. A white sparkle appears on the side as it rotates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The rotating cube, the white
star.....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: .....which look
really, really primitive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Again, see above. This
logo is slightly easier to come across, seeing that it is more
recent.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>SVS/Triumph</B></font><font
face="Arial"><br>
(1990-1991)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Same as RCA/Columbia Logo 2,
only the cube now has a blue rectangle, with &quot;SVS&quot; in a
serif font, then a line, then &quot;TRIUMPH&quot; underneath in a
condensed font.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Same as RCA/Columbia logo 2.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: The logo is very rare.
This was a &quot;bridge&quot; between the RCA/Columbia and C-T
eras, releasing Triumph's releases, and some &quot;low-profile&quot;
Columbia and TriStar releases. The label disappeared in 1991 when
Columbia-TriStar Home Video was formed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Part I: The Boxes
Cometh&quot;, &quot;Split Rectangle&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black bg, we see a split
rectangle. On the left side, we see the 80s Torch Lady(Print
Version), and on the right, the TriStar &quot;Pegasus Over
Pyramid&quot; logo(print version too, but minus the &quot;PICTURES&quot;
at the bottom). Above, we see the words &quot;</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">COLUMBIA TRISTAR</font><font
face="Arial">&quot;, one above the other, and at the bottom, we
see &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">HOME VIDEO</font><font
face="Arial">&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None, this is a still logo</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Quite rare, this is
the very first logo featuring a box motif, which would eventually
develop into the familiar and hated Columbia-Tristar Home Video
and Columbia-Tristar Television logos. Also, this is a &quot;Placeholder
Logo&quot;, a logo that is used on a show or video when the new
one isn't quite ready yet. This is a rare occurance, but such
logos do exist.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Part II: The Boxes
Take Form&quot;, &quot;The First Box Logo&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a white bg, we see two
boxes. On the left is one featuring a newly-done Torch Lady, and
on the right is a newly-done Pegasus on a Columbia-like cloud
background. Above the boxes are the words &quot;</font><font
color="#0000FF" face="Arial">COLUMBIA TRISTAR</font><font
face="Arial">&quot;, with each word positioned over its
respective logo.&quot;</font><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">HOME

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None, this is a still logo</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Another placeholder
logo, but this time they've actually designed the new logos. :)
If I'm not mistaken, this is the first appearance of the new
&quot;Sony Logos&quot; for each company. Again, pretty rare.</font>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo<br>
(1993-)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Part III: Will This
Logo Ever Die?!&quot;, &quot;Sliding Boxes&quot;, &quot;Blue BG
Boxes&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We see a screen full of clouds
forming, tossing about. Then, &quot;COLUMBIA TRISTAR&quot; zooms
out from above, and &quot;HOME VIDEO&quot; shrinks out from below
as we see the clouds zoom out, as part of a golden-bordered box
on a blue-black gradient background. The box then splits apart to
reveal the Torch Lady on the left, and the Pegasus on the right,
as the wording takes its position.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variation</u>: Some New Line Home Video
releases distributed by C-T have a Sony Pictures Entertainment
byline on the bottom.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The zooming out effects, nice
CGI.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: It seems a bit dated,
and the Pegasus looks like it was pasted on top of the Columbia
logo, as the cloud backgrounds are the same. TriStar used a
different, darker cloud bg, which is why.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A rather simple synth theme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Current. I think. You
see, I have come to the conclusion that the people running
Columbia-Tristar are insane. There have been no less than three
logos coming after this one, and yet this was used concurrently
with these very same logos, with some releases featuring this
logo and the supposedly &quot;current&quot; one! My God, it's
like seeing UA94 one minute, and then Turning UA the next! These
people are insane :) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">4th Logo<br>
(1996-1997)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Take Hollywood Home!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a brownish bg, we see a row
of Torch Lady and Pegasus boxes at an angle (all are print logos).
The Coulmbia and TriStar boxes then rise out of two of the boxes
in the center as the row of boxes tilts to face the screen. The
&quot;</font><font color="#808000" face="Arial">COLUMBIA TRISTAR</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; and &quot;</font><font color="#808000"
face="Arial">HOME VIDEO</font><font face="Arial">&quot; lines
fade in above and below the logo, respectively.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Simple but nice animation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A loud, booming chorus
singing &quot;TAKE HOLLYWOOD HOOOOOOOOOME!!!!!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: C-T used this logo in
1996 to 1997 and as a result this was probably used on most
releases. I'm not sure if it was alternated with the blue bg
logo, so as always, keep your eye out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: High, because of that
sudden chorus.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">5th Logo<br>
(1997-2000)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The Filmstrip&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On an ethereal blue
background, we see filmstrips crisscrossing the screen, with each
frame in each filmstrip featuring the C-T box logo. We see a
filmstrip in the center of the screen and then pan towards it,
seeing the boxes in each frame and the endings of their
respective movie animations playing out within them. As the final
frame reaches the screen, the background turns all white and the
&quot;</font><font color="#004080" face="Arial">COLUMBIA TRISTAR
HOME VIDEO</font><font face="Arial">&quot; text fades in.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>The Clip On</u>: Many times,
the boxes would then slide away, the CTHV text would fade out,
and one of the following phrases, in script, would zoom in from
the center of the logo. </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Coming Soon to Home Video</font>
    </li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Coming Soon To Theatres </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now Available</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Afterwards, a trailer with one of
the following features would be played.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Great CGI. And if you thought
this one was good, the next one is even more mind-blowing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: No music. Although, after the
debacle that was &quot;Take Hollywood Home!&quot; this seems to
be a good thing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: During the beginning
of its existence it was pretty easy to spot, then around 1998 it
began being used along with the blue bg logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">6th Logo<br>
(2000-) (DVD Version)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;C-T DVD&quot;,
&quot;The Boxes of Splendor&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a screen filled with
clouds, the words &quot;</font><font color="#808080" face="Arial">COLUMBIA</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; and &quot;</font><font color="#808080"
face="Arial">TRISTAR</font><font face="Arial">&quot;, handsomely
done in shining silver text, tumble onto the screen, &quot;</font><font
color="#808080" face="Arial">COLUMBIA</font><font face="Arial">&quot;
coming from the right and &quot;</font><font color="#808080"
face="Arial">TRISTAR</font><font face="Arial">&quot; coming from
the left. The clouds clear, revealing a nice backdrop of clouds
and two white, glowing boxes. As the light in the boxes die down,
we zoom towards the Columbia torch lady in the left box, and see
the pegasus stretch his wings in the white box, as the wings
cross over to the Columbia box. The words &quot;</font><font
color="#808080" face="Arial">COLUMBIA</font><font face="Arial">&quot;
and &quot;</font><font color="#808080" face="Arial">TRISTAR</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; position themselves under the boxes, and
&quot;</font><font color="#808080" face="Arial">DVD</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; zooms out from the top, at warp speed,
landing below the C-T text.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Too Little</u>: C-T has adapted
this logo for VHS releases; however, this has only been seen on
&quot;Stuart Little&quot; so far-guess what logo they're STILL
using on VHS?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Mind-blowing CGI, and has
become a favorite of those who've seen it. Some have even
suggested that C-T should adapt this logo for their television
division. If they're gonna update logos, they'd better use one
with the best CGI they can muster :)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music/Sound FX</u>: Whooshing sounds as
the Columbia Tristar logos move into position. An ethereal
humming noise as the boxes animate, and a phaser sound as the
&quot;DVD&quot; text moves into place.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: It's seen on most
current DVD releases from the company; prior to this, they used
the blue bg logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: The &quot;DVD&quot;
zooming out will probably get to more than a few.</font> </p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Columbia Tristar Home
Entertainment<br>
</B></font><font face="Arial">(2001-) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Over the usual cloud
background, we pan past an extreme close up of the Torch Lady's
legs and feet(covered in the robe of course), then dissolves into
a pan of the TriStar Pegasus unfolding his wings. The pan then
quickly dissolves into a shot from the center of the Pegasus
unfolding his wings, albeit in a close-up fashion, and then a
dissolve to the Torch Lady zooming out. The logo then dissolves
to reveal the Torch Lady and Pegasus side-by-side on a cloud
background, with &quot;COLUMBIA TRISTAR&quot; slightly sliding in
with &quot;HOME ENTERTAINMENT&quot;, in a smaller font, fading in
letter-by-letter. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Of course, that isn't the
entire logo. Throughout the animation, the logos are artistically
stylized, with mosaic and pixelization effects being used
throught the logo and a scrollign Matrix-like wall of typography
appearing throughout. Also, the designers of the logo, Montgomery/Cobb,
retouched the face of the Torch Lady and the wings of the Pegasus
to make them more realistic. The dissolves are done gradually,
almost like wipes, and the logo seems to be divided up into five
sections during the animation, before coming together as an
actual logo at the end. The logo looks quite nice and artistic as
a result. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Composed by Machine Head of
Venice, California, it is a wonderful synthesized fanfare that is
very majestic, fitting the majestic feel of the logo. Also, it
would be interesting to note that the logo is one of the longest,
clocking in at nearly 20 seconds! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: It is just going into
use, and should be seen on most new Columbia Tristar DVDs and
Videocassettes. It is not known at this time if there will be
separate versions for VHS and DVD releases. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: This is going to be a
popular logo that will finally put one version of the hated Boxes
to rest. Nice fanfare and great logo concept make this a winner;
if only C-T could adapt it for Television somehow... </font></p>
