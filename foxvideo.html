<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Two
semicircles with lines protruding down their midsections are drawn
into view. Suddenly, the structure briefly flashes white and a bunch
of circle Ms appear in back of it, sort of like a mirrored effect.
The words "MAGNETIC VIDEO CORPORATION" in a computerized font begin
to scroll upward, and like the M, have copies appearing behind the
logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Voiceovers</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Like Thorn EMI/HBO/Cannon, Magnetic was primarily a video
distributor-the FIRST video company, actually. They made special
deals with United Artists, Avco Embassy, ITC, ABC, and 20th Century
Fox. Fox bought them shortly thereafter. All Magnetic logos have a
voiceover indicating the studio: "Through special arrangement with
&lt;STUDIO NAME&gt;, Magnetic Video Corporation is pleased to present
this motion picture on videocassette."</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
circle M being drawn in, the scrolling words</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Off the charts. Made up of primitive computer graphics and very cheap
chyron like that used in the first seasons of Wheel of Fortune.
Possibly tied for cheapest-looking logo, with Embassy Home
Entertainment #1 and FHE #1.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A very
synthesized piece of music; not very easy to hear due to the studio
spiel, but has a bossa-nova influenced, easy listening melody.</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Magnetic's titles have been out of print for decades now, with most
titles being re-released by the various home divisions of Fox and
MGM. Can be found at used video stores.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
standard 20th Century Fox logo, with the shortened music. No
indication of a video indicator whatsoever. However, like Magnetic,
there is a voiceover, presumably similar to Magnetic's (20th Century
Fox titles most likely had a different spiel, but UA and ABC movies
probably had the same spiel with "20th Century Fox Video" replacing
any mention of Magnetic.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
orange background, two grids are moving from the top and bottom of
the screen converging in the center of the screen. CBS comes from the
top at an angle, with FOX coming from the bottom at an angle. The
background turns into blue, and CBS and FOX right themselves in the
center of the screen. The letters of the word VIDEO fly in from the
bottom center of the screen one at a time.</FONT></P>

converging of the two grids and the logo, the flying of the VIDEO
letters.</FONT></P>

Sounds highly scanimated! The later logo was much better!</FONT></P>

same horn fanfare that was heard on the 1984-98 logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Not many videos featured this logo. Most videos that may have used
this logo were issued in the same oversized boxes that were used by
20th Century Fox Video. Two videos that feature this logo include the
1983 release of "Star Wars" and "Heart Like a Wheel".</FONT></P>

The beginning of the animation looks kinda tacky by starting in a
black gradient area.</FONT></P>

triumphant horn march, about 10-15 sec. long.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
CBS-FOX does not exist as a company anymore. They released many NBA
related films in the mid-late 80's and videos of musical artists
under the CBS Records/Columbia label. Most 20th Century Fox releases
were made through this label, or would be put on the Playhouse or Key
Video labels.</FONT></P>

shot of the famous 20th Century Fox structure, from a slightly
different angle, dull brownish color against a simple blue
background. The wording on the structure now says "FOX VIDEO", with
an extra bar below where "FOX" would be in the movie logo. The logo
"shimmers" as a bar of light moves through ala the Touchstone
logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
"shimmer".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The Fox equivalent of WB's 1995-2001 Television Animation logo. Looks
very, very harsh and ugly.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: No
music :(, which is something that will plague all Fox Video logos
(come on, you've got the world's most-recognizable fanfare, USE
IT!)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
On all Fox Videos from that period-the best way to find this is to
look for a Fox Video print logo that is a simple 2-d drawing with no
color.</FONT></P>

dark purple background, we see a Fox structure, from an extreme
upper-left angle. We move down and pan around the structure, saying
"FOX VIDEO" like in logo #1, before settling into the familiar angle
we usually see Fox logos from.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
computer animation, which is a variation of the movie's animation
:)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
:( unfortunately, really BAD computer animation. The color scheme is,
to put it mildly, god-awful. The font used for "FOX VIDEO" is ALL
WRONG, and the background :) my god, couldn't they have at LEAST used
a NORMAL-LOOKING sky?!</FONT></P>

no music :( *sigh*</FONT></P>

by panning across the Los Angeles skyline at around sunset. We see a
spotlight and then pan across the "FOX VIDEO" structure, now redone
so that it looks a lot better. We zoom out until we reach the
comfortable Fox logo distance.</FONT></P>

animation.</FONT></P>

More a nitpick than anything, but the Fox Video logo is STILL not
right.</FONT></P>

Silence. Unfortunately.</FONT></P>

the 1993-present Fox logo, with no News Corporation byline. We then
