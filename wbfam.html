<FONT FACE="Arial">(Used in 1990)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
navy blue background, we see the Warner Bros. Cartoons concentric
circles logo. An MGM-like ribbon is below it, with a golden-colored
WB shield in the center. Bugs Bunny pops out of the circles and the
ribbon "shines" with the "WB" transforming into "50". In script below
it, "Happy Birthday Bugs" is written out. Bugs then munches on his
carrot. This was used for Bugs Bunny's 50th anniversary (a lot of
fuss was made from various stations)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
shining ribbon, the scriptwriting, the fading of "WB" to "50" in the
shield.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Nothing overly cheesy about this logo-- this is actually fairly
low-key.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: No
music, the only sound is of Bugs munching his carrot.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Could be seen on "Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show" and WB specials during
1989-1990. This logo actually was used on the Lethal Weapon 1990
video release in place of the regular WB shield logo! (And as WB was
in the midst of the Time Warner merger at this time, this may explain
the LW edit and why this logo has no Warner Communications or Time
Warner byline)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Nothing, this logo is clean.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1997 movie version)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
black background and from a far distance, two figures, the words
"KIDS'", and "WB" in the font from the shield logo but weirdly
arranged and with an exclamation point at the end, zoom towards the
screen. They then collide with the screen and then abruptly move
back. The logos then wobble. The standard Time Warner Entertainment
Company disclaimer fades in at the bottom of the screen.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
entire animation of the logo, which is all CGI.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: No
music, but this actually increases the scare factor...</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Can be seen on Pokemon: The First Movie and maybe Pokemon: The Movie
2000 (I'm not sure on the last one-- I've only seen promos on Cartoon
Network which have the 1999 shield logo on a space background-- but I
also saw PTFM promos on CN with the 1999 shield, so who knows...).
This is actually odd, as Kids' WB is actually a television network
and not a releasing division of WB...</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
High, the fact that this logo has EXTREMELY abrupt animation on a
black background makes this logo creepy, even without music!</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The WB
shield is, as usual, posed against the sky, but without a ribbon.
Then Bugs Bunny (in a tuxedo) leans over the shield, puts a hoop-like
ribbon around it, and spins it around. "A TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT
COMPANY" appears under the logo as Bugs steps to the left, does the
Vanna White Pose, and puts his hand on the ribbon to stop it. The
ribbon reads "FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT," and Bugs keeps his hand on it as
he leans and eats his carrot.</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">An uncommon variant is where the ribbon is
   already around/formed and Bugs appears as usual.</FONT>

   cartoons in the early 90s.</FONT>

version of "Merrily We Roll Along"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Can be seen on Warner Brother's family orientated films of the era
and the abridged TV opener can be seen on mid 90s TV series such as
"Taz Mania" and "The Adventures Of Batman and Robin"</FONT></P>

picture of the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank is seen with a
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#808000">gold</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"> tint. The picture "waves" for a bit and then rotates,
revealing that it is the WB Family Entertainment shield looking
similar to Logo #1, but redone in CGI and reflecting the studio. The
logo rotates towards us and zooms out to its usual position, with the
company byline fading in underneath. Bugs steps to the left from
under the shield and puts his hand on the shield as he leans and eats
his carrot.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Just VERY
good CGI.</FONT></P>
