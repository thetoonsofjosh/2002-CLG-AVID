<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1950s-1971)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The Hammer&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Two hands work on a silver
sheet of metal, holding a stamp in place and hitting it twice
with a hammer. When the hands and tools pull away, we see a
&quot;VII&quot; imprinted on the metal. Above the roman numeral
in white is the word &quot;MARK,&quot; and below &quot;LIMITED.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Mostly live action, or seems to
be, so not much as far as actual special effect are concerned.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The words appearing
over the &quot;live&quot; picture</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A drum roll (or maybe a
machine growling) and two &quot;clinks&quot; of the hammer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Can be seen on &quot;Dragnet&quot;
reruns. As an interesting sidenote, the soundtrack to the Mark
VII logo was also used for the Ghost Planet Industries logo on
&quot;Space Ghost: Coast to Coast,&quot; and also the beginning
to wrestler Greg &quot;The Hammer&quot; Valentine's 1991 theme
music in the WWF.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, bordering on
moderate, this is a popular and memorable logo, having one of the
most famous soundtracks in all of logos. But it is
understandable, that some may be turned off by the loud nature or
the sweaty palm. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1971-1973)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Shocking Gold&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a gold background, we see
the following outlined phrase taking up nearly the whole screen:</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">A Production of</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">MARK</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">VII</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">LIMITED</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None really, this is a still
logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A bombastic, dramatic
orchestral fanfare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Still exists at the
end of Mark VII-produced shows from this period.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: High, because of the
music and phrase taking up nearly the whole screen. Usually
following a dramatic closing theme (like Adam-12) really doesn't
help much either.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1973-1979)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The Hammer Strikes
Back&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: It's the same as the 1950s-1971
variant, but it starts midway through the animation; just one
hammer strike revealing &quot;VII&quot; and the words &quot;MARK&quot;
and &quot;LIMITED&quot; fade in at the same time afterwards.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX/Cheesy Factor</u>: Same as the 1950s-1971
logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A&quot;clink&quot; of the
hammer followed by a drum roll.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Still exists at the
end of Mark VII-produced shows from this period.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Moderate, this edited
version of the original is a bit higher due to the fast pacing,
but shouldn't be too bad to most.</font></p>
