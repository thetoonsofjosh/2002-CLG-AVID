<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1st Logo</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1966-1974)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: "The
Box"</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There were 3 versions of this logo, and they
will be described here.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo 1 (early prototype,
1966)</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Over a black background, three
orange lines trail (the outer 2 going down, the one in the center
going up), then they break into small rectangles forming a box
containing a stylized HB. The box then becomes an orange background,
as the HB zooms out to the near center. The HB turns into a black
box, and the phrase "a hanna-barbera production" pops in afterward.
(The "a" appears inside the black box) Finally, the stylized HB fades
in underlapping the company text.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo 2 (standard version)</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Over a black background with a quick glide up the
musical scale, a yellow stylized HB zooms in to fill the screen. The
HB stops and turns orange over a yellow background under the phrase
"a hanna-barbera production, a division of taft broadcasting
company". A small orange box appears behind the "a" in the company
text. The Taft company logo, with the words Progress-Public-Trust
appears next to the Taft byline, which was seen between 1968 and
1971.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo 3 (different variation,
1969-1971)</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Over a black background,
three red mini rectangles trail (the outer 2 going down, the one in
the center going up), then they multiply into more rectangles forming
a box containing a stylized HB. The box then becomes a red
background, as the HB fades to light blue. The phrase "a
hanna-barbera production, A Taft BROADCASTING COMPANY" fades in while
the HB changes its color. A small pink-outlined box with purple
inside appears behind the "a" in the company text. The Taft company
logo appears within the Taft byline this time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Arial">(Note: The bylineless variation is
the most common, and can be seen currently on Cartoon
Network/Boomerang shows with this logo)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX/Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: The "box covering screen" effect.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
early rendition of the logo features a fast-paced sting of a
chime-driven fanfare. The regular logo has a musical scale glide with
a brass band and then lower notes are played. The latter sounder was
dropped in 1971 and the logo was eventually played under the music
outro of a series' end titles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Arial">(Note: "The New Scooby Movies" and
"SuperFriends" were among those that played their theme music over
the logo.)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Can still be seen on many H-B cartoons on Cartoon Network and
Boomerang like "Scooby-Doo," "Super Friends" and "Wacky Races". The
early prototype appeared at the end of the 1966 NBC special "Jack and
the Beanstalk" starring Gene Kelly.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
High, it has caused nightmares with the "slide" music and terrible
logo design with abruptness.</FONT></P>

"Hanna-Barbera," which "blossoms" into into a stylized "H-B" with a
scrolling rainbow pattern filled with "Hanna-Barberas." Below the

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: In this
still logo, we see a strange shaded background that consists of 3
circles (kinda like the Looney Tunes ones, but less obvious) of
(outer to inner) blue, light green, and solid green. On this
background is the following text:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">and</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Turner Entertainment Co.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Cartoon</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The text is all in white and centered. There is
some spacing between lines as well. The H-B text is in a
cursive/paintbrush type font, while the Turner text is in a plain,
blocky font, similar to end credits used on some Marvel shows of the
80s. To the left of the Turner line is an abstract star logo, made by
a border of parallelograms, and almost resembling the common
"recycling" logo seen in the US.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Arial">(Note: An earlier version exists.
It's almost the same, only it has a still, colorless version of the
swirling star and "Hanna-Barbera" above the Turner logo.)</FONT></P>

it's a still logo</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Just a gripe, but why would Hanna-Barbera submit to having their
company name initialized?</FONT></P>

just the end theme to "Tom &amp; Jerry Kids"</FONT></P>

As far as I know, was only shown on the "Tom &amp; Jerry Kids"
series. Up until a few years ago, it was seen on Cartoon Network and
a few local stations. So whenever someone wants to run the show, this
logo should remain intact.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The bouncy theme makes it low, but if this logo was ever used w/o
music, it might rise a bit due to the strange font and text
considerations.</FONT></P>

Uncle Fester is in the rectangle. Quick-cuts of cartoon characters
from past and present were introduced in 1994. There are two
variations, one for comedy (i.e. "2 Stupid Dogs"), the other for
action (i.e. "Swat Kats", "Real Adventures of Johnny Quest"). The
quick-cuts end on a "boing". The comedy one ends on Fred Flintstone

On a white background, we see a very "grungy" variation on the
"Cartoon Network" logo constantly flashing on the screen. A vertical
chartreuse light cursor moves from left to right "printing" the CN
logo in its place. The cursor moves from right to left again, the CN

printing the checkered text "STUDIOS" below the logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo Variations</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Like the MTM logo, the basic logo described above is
often customized for the show it appears on. Basically, the Cartoon
Network Studios logo described above appears on a background, the
"CARTOON NETWORK" above and "STUDIOS" below opens away from each
other vertically like a mouth, the characters do their act, then the
logo closes again. However, the characters in the logo vary depending
on the show. Here are the variations:</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Time Squad</FONT></U><FONT

   looks to the button on his right and pushes it. The characters
   disappear in a zap of light.</FONT>
   
   <LI><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Grim and Evil</FONT></U><FONT

   Grim is holding a scythe. With a wicked grin on his face, he
   swings his scythe in an effort to "behead" Billy and Mandy, but
   the kids hide under their shirts and he misses.</FONT>
   
   <LI><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Samurai Jack</FONT></U><FONT

   his body to the left posing the sword like a baseball bat, and
   quickly swings the sword right and left breaking the lip of the
   Cartoon Network Studios logo, which promptly closes.</FONT>
   
   <LI><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Dexter’s Laboratory</FONT></U><FONT
   FACE="Arial">: Dee Dee stands on the left with her finger pointed

bolt slides in from the top-left behind the star, landing so that the
star is in the middle of the lightning bolt. The screen flashes a few
times and two rectangles slide in from the top and bottom of the
screen, behind the star and lightning bolt, the top one yellow, the
bottom one purple. When they connect with each other, the colors
suddenly swap so that the top one is purple and the bottom one is
yellow. In the purple rectangle, to the right of the star/bolt
contraption, is "A SOUTHERN STAR" in a yellow-colored thin italic
font, and in the yellow bottom rectangle is "Hanna Barbera Australia
