TV version</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">, with "Presents" below or "A

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX/Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
same Elliot/Ferguson musical scale was played sometimes. Other times,
the logo was silent.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Pretty rare, the silent version was spotted on a cable showing of
"Tank", and the video version of "The Last Starfighter." Warner Bros.
used to plaster their logo over this one, but it is hard to tell if
this logo will be preserved, due to the low output of films by
Lorimar. "Being There" and "An Officer and a Gentleman" were other
notable Lorimar titles.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
A little tamer than the TV version, but still moderate. The silence
that usually accompanied this logo helped, but with the uncommon use
of that music, it could rise a bit.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1986-1992)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"Sunburst"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Starts
with a </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFF00">yellow
flash</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> with a </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">white sunburst</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> in the
middle. As the flash fades, the logo slowly comes forward. It
consists of the words "LORIMAR" with "MOTION PICTURES" under that.
All the words are red with white and blue outlines. Under the "Motion
Pictures" is an upside down triangle shape with white lines to give
the logo a 3-D look. At the point of the triangle is a half circle
shaped space, and as the logo forms the sunburst becomes a little
yellow flash of light that moves downward and enters the opening at
the logo's bottom. Under the entire logo are the words "A Division of
Lorimar-Telepictures."</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Another Sunburst?</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Because of the usage of lights and flashes, this logo
has been compared to the popular Columbia Pictures Television logo of
1975-82, hence its also being called a "sunburst."</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
moving logo and the light joining it.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Silent,
usually the movies opening song or soundtrack started to play over
this logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
As with many '80s logos, you'll have to look for older issues of
certain videos. Most Lorimar movies are now out of print today. It
has appeared at the beginning of "Action Jackson" (the Lorimar Home
Video copy), "The Boy Who Could Fly" and "The Morning After." It is
generally rare, considering that Lorimar put out few movies while
teamed up with Telepictures.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Pretty harmless, though the dramatics of the flash and those words
slowly approaching may get to some, I'd imagine. It does depend on
the music playing over it, as one movie with the logo starts with a
"SMACK" or explosion as the logo comes.</FONT></P>

FACE="Arial">: Before L-T started this company under the
"Karl-Lorimar" name, most Lorimar features were issued by either
MGM/UA Home Video, or CBS/FOX Home Video</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
multi-colored line of red/orange/yellow/blue sweeps onto the screen.
It straightens out, and sets itself down at the bottom of the screen.
Then a whole mess of gray dust collects and converges above the "Home
Video" bar, forming the "Karl-Lorimar (or) Lorimar" logo. Then to
give it a shiny look, little stars sparkle at the letter's edges in
time with the "ding ding ding" fadeout of the music.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX/Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: The logo flying with the trail, the (Karl) Lorimar
dissolving in. </FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: All
synths, all the time on this one. A synth sweep brings in the bar,
and as the dust forms the logo, a 5 note synth melody plays. The
music closes with a "ding ding ding....." fade out.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Has rare written all over it. Try finding a good WORKING copy of a
Lorimar Home Video release, and you'll have it. Their videos never
sold too well, so this will be a tough one to find. All Lorimar
releases are now re-issued as WB Home Entertainment releases.</FONT>
