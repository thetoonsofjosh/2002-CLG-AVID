<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial">By James Fabiano,
Matt Williams and Adam P.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Marvel Productions Ltd</B></font><br>
<font face="Arial">1st Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1981-1986)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;MP&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a blue background, several
large sets of lines rotate. Over the lines, a &quot;star&quot;
traces out the company logo that of a stylized &quot;MP&quot;,
with another M cut out of the &quot;M&quot; part of the logo.
When the logo is fully traced and the lines are in position (with
horizontal lines for the M part and vertical lines for the P),
the logo flashes, and the M cut out turns white while the rest
turns yellow. The logo shrinks to the top-left corner, and &quot;MARVEL
PRODUCTIONS LTD&quot; is drawn out with a star below it in a font
not unlike the 1970s Filmways logo. &quot;A CADENCE COMPANY&quot;
is similarly drawn out on the bottom-right of the screen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The &quot;star&quot; effects
and drawing in of the logo, and the rotating lines, which remind
one of Avco-Embassy's logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A very dramatic fanfare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Most Marvel shows of
this time have been updated with either the second logo or a
Saban logo. However, you may still see this logo on some videos
of Marvel shows of this time. It also turned up sometimes when
&quot;Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends&quot; was being reran on
UPN.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: The fanfare is overly
dramatic and the animation is cheesy, so some might be startled
by it.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1986-1993)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: In space, we pan out through a
series of glowing 3D bars. As the bars rotate up towards us, we
see that it is the Marvel Productions logo, done in glorious 3D (and
with the M cut-out not filled in). In the background, a CGI
Spider-Man leaps up, and the logo is &quot;absorbed&quot; into
his body, turning him silver. The space background goes to &quot;timewarp&quot;
into a silver background, as the words &quot;MARVEL PRODUCTIONS,
LTD&quot; rise up from the bottom-right with a trail behind it.
The MP logo returns to the screen, as the silver Spider-Man
somersaults to the top of it and takes a prowler-like stance
above it as the logo takes its place on the center of the screen.
The Marvel Productions text takes its place below the logo.
&quot;A New World Company&quot; fades in when the animation is
all done.</font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Arial">(Note: The reason for the MP logo
being absorbed and then mysteriously reappearing is to provide a
place to cut the logo so that it is not as long-in most cases,
however, the logo is shortened so that only the tail-end of the
animation is seen)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: EXCELLENT CGI Effects; this
logo holds up VERY well, even today, and the CGI effects were
ahead of its time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A THX-like &quot;chord&quot;
sound-on the 1989 X-Men pilot, a synth tune is heard</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Rare, the short
version was seen on many shows, most notably &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;
-the longer version can be considered extinct.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Minimal, just awe-inspiring
computer animation :)</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Marvel Entertainment Group</B></font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1992-1997)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black/gray gradient
background, a yellow &quot;starburst&quot; appears. Inside it is
the current Marvel Comics logo, consisting of a large &quot;M&quot;
design with &quot;MARVEL&quot; embedded into it. Across the M is
the word &quot;COMICS&quot; scrawled in a graffiti-like font.
Next to the logo is a larger blue sunburst with &quot;MARVEL
ENTERTAINMENT GROUP&quot; inside of it in a plain font.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Nothing, this is a static logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: The end theme of the show,
usually.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Most 1992-1997 Marvel
shows have it, but X-Men's logo has been updated with the current
Marvel Studios logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Not scary at all.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Marvel Films/Studios</B></font><br>
<font face="Arial">1st Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1992-1997)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background, in a
white square, a logo similar to the Marvel Comics logo is seen,
but the M now has squares cut out on either side of it and &quot;Films&quot;
written in script across it. &quot;A Division of New World
Entertainment&quot; appears below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variation</u>: A different logo was used
on Spider-Man. It featured the Marvel/M combination tilting and
zooming out to face us. In the M is an animation of Spider-Man.
Once the M reaches its position, it flashes and &quot;Films&quot;
is written, in script. The background is a space bg and the New
World disclaimer appears below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Nothing for the regular, but
the Spidey logo had the tilting and flash.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The tilting and flash
on Spidey's logo look kind of fake.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: The end of the show's theme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Most Marvel shows from
this period keep this logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Not scary, more effort
was spent on this.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1997-99)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: In space, a globe of the Earth
spins around. From the bottom of the screen, a red, bold &quot;MARVEL&quot;
zooms up, and from the top, the Marvel M made out the same way as
the Marvel Films logo but with nothing written across it, zooms
towards the bottom. When they both reach their respective points,
both logo flashes, and the words &quot;ENTERTAINMENT GROUP, INC.&quot;
appear under the Marvel logo, and the word &quot;Studios&quot;
appears on the Marvel M. After the flash, the countries on the
globe are now filled in with pictures of the Marvel Comics
characters.</font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Arial">(Note: The words &quot;Based on
the Marvel Comics Characters&quot; appeared under this logo on
&quot;Silver Surfer&quot;.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The spinning globe, the flying
words and flashing logos</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Pretty low budget,
although not as bad as the Marvel Entertainment logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: End of the show's theme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: It was only seen on
two Marvel shows-Silver Surfer on Fox Kids, and the (abysmal)
second season of The Incredible Hulk on UPN. Therefore, it was
only used for one year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Not scary at all</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1999-)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a blue shiny background, we
see a backlit Marvel M, with nothing written across it. Suddenly,
out of nowhere, a red &quot;Studios&quot;, written in script,
zooms out and plasters itself on top of the M. As it plasters
itself on top of the M, the Marvel M shines and lights up,
revealing the same granite-like finish in the previous two logos.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Nifty CGI</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Not as much cheesy as
confusing-it's kinda hard to tell what's going on as the
animation goes by so fast.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A loud phaser-like sound.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Could be seen on The
Avengers and Spider-Man Unlimited when Fox ran them, and is now
appearing on Fox Kids broadcasts of X-Men (with Saban's twirly-doo
logo; both have been updated to coincide with FK's generic
credits format) A still of this can be seen on &quot;X-Men
Evolution&quot;, as it is crammed into the side credits to make
room for Kids WB promos.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: The loud phasing sound
could get to some.</font></p>
