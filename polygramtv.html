<hr>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Background</u>: PolyGram Pictures Ltd.,
the short-lived original film production company founded by Jon
Peters and Phil Guber (1979-83) of PolyGram Records, also had a
television division,whose logo was similar to the PolyGram
Pictures ID seen on feature films. This division managed to
survive until 1987 while PolyGram Pictures was closed by PolyGram
N.V. in late 1983. PolyGram re-entered movie production in 1986
(the new film unit being known as PolyGram Filmed
Entertainment),ultimately returning to television.<br>
<br>
The other logos used by PolyGram in the 1990s (once it bought ITC
and The Samuel Goldwyn Company's library) are also detailed here.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">PolyGram TeleVision, Ltd.</font><font
face="Arial"><br>
1st Logo<br>
(1981-87)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a metallic sky-blue
background, the PolyGram logo appears almost completely formed
with the letters P,G,T and V in large, thick uppercase letters
(but still closely matching the font used in the PolyGram print
logo. As this appears, the uppercase letters spread apart
revealing the rest of the company name (in thinner font,again
closely matching the PolyGram print logo) and the line of stars
slide into place under the company name. Streaks of glare pass
over various parts of the logo.<br>
<br>
<u>FX</u>: The line of stars zipping into place,the larger
letters splitting apart,the glare streaks passing over the logo. <br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Near Time-Life Television levels with crude
early CGI animation (the line of stars and the
&quot;glide-in&quot; of the rest of the company name)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Either the closing of the end
theme music or silence<br>
<br>
<u>Avaliability</u>: Extremely Rare-give yourself a round of
applause if you locate this anywhere. Apart from a few TV movies
and the few films PolyGram made between 1979 and 1982 (which were
later syndicated by <br>
King Features Entertainment) plus the panel-discussion show
&quot;Agronsky and Co.&quot;, PolyGram in the early Eighties had
virtually no presence outside music. Their very limited TV
output, whenever aired should have this logo intact folowed by
the MGM Lion.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Given its omnipresence in music (and
familiarity from album covers and print ads), the PolyGram logo
as seen on a TV screen might've actually inspired awe rather than
fear given its look. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">Logo #2<br>
(UK and international only)<br>
(1993-96)<br>
<br>
<u>Background</u>: After buying ITC Entertainment Group in
1993,PolyGram renamed the company PolyGram Television Ltd. and
affixed the following logo on prints of ITC shows aired in
Britain (see below;the US division kept the ITC name and logo
[operating as ITC Distribution,Inc.] until 1997).<br>
<br>
<u>Nickname</u>: &quot;CLANG!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background, we see
the legend &quot;PolyGram Television&quot; in thick, white font
&quot;fold&quot; itself into place (clicks and a whirring noise
are overheard as this happens). A thin red line then glows
briefly and <br>
shrinks into position under the company name. Once the red line
is in place, a dull metallic &quot;CLANG!&quot; is heard.<br>
This was modelled after the PolyGram Records print logo of the
era (1989-98).<br>
<br>
<u>FX/Music</u>: The same as the 1994-97 PolyGram Video logo.<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The same PolyGram Video-style flipping
letters and shrinking red line,the &quot;CLANG!&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Availiability</u>: Extremely Rare-if you've seen this,you were
very lucky indeed. This was primarily a distribution logo in the
UK and other countries except the US. <br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Minimal, the &quot;CLANG!&quot; might
startle a few but all and all harmless.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">PolyGram
Television/International/Visual Programming Ltd.</font><font
face="Arial"><br>
Logo #3 (overall;2nd US logo)<br>
(1997-99) <br>
<br>
<u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;PolyGram Wing Man&quot;,
&quot;Icarus&quot;<br>
<br>
[Note: This is an abridged version of PolyGram's final (1996-99)
movie logo-a more complete, detailed description of which can be
found in the PolyGram Filmed Entertainment section. Only the tail
end of the sequence was used on television.]<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: On a ominous-looking darkened, cloudy skyscape, we
see a winged man take flight from a steep cliff surface. As he
begins his flight, he freezes still. As the Icarus stops, light
streaks pass over him. The phrase POLYGRAM TELEVISION, in a
stylized font and centered under the winged man, zooms into place
(also with the same streaking EFX). Both the Icarus and company
name appear to be living crystal. <br>
<br>
<u>FX</u>: State-of-the-art CGI animation (the full version of
which was never used by the television unit).<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: None, or the end theme music's outro<br>
<br>
<u>Variations</u>:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">A still version with &quot;DISTRIBUTED
        BY&quot; in small yellow/orange type above the Icarus was
        plastered onto some ITC feature films and television
        shows.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The print version was seen in the
        closing credits of the Nick Jr. cartoon
        &quot;Maisie.&quot;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">A version existed with the phrase
        POLYGRAM TELEVISION INTERNATIONAL under the winged man.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Avaliability</u>: Extinct. Immediately
following the merger of PolyGram and Universal Studios, PolyGram
logos from most 1996-99 PolyGram Filmed Entertainment films and
television programs were deleted and replaced with the current
Universal Glittering Globe. The &quot;Maisie&quot; credits had
the PolyGram Icarus and credit replaced with the current
Universal print logo (on episodes currently seen on Noggin) and a
credit for Universal Visual Programming Ltd. above it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The ITC library was later sold to Carlton
International Media,while the remaining pre-March 1996 PolyGram
film library was sold to MGM. Outside off-air tapes of
&quot;Motown Live!&quot;,&quot;The Crow:Stairway to Heaven&quot;
and ITC library shows from the two years this logo was used
(1997-99),this is history.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: The dark skyline and winged man might very
well unsettle some viewers (especially if unfamiliar with the
Greek fable about Icarus, the man who constructed a set of wings
and tried to fly to the sun) as well as the freeze-frame and CGI
effects animation used thoughout but should be of minimal effect
for those who had never seen this ID before. This remains among
the best CGI logos of recent years, regardless of its dark look. </font></p>
