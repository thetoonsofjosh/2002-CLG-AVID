On a </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#808080">gray</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"> background, the words "WARNER BROS. PICTURES, INC."
appeared, and below that "&amp; THE VITAPHONE CORP." appears in a
much smaller font, with the "VITAPHONE" using "electric" style
letters. Below that is a very small WB shield which zooms up from a
distance in the beginning (thus initiating a tradition), and in
script, "Present". Behind it there is the drawing of a flag, "waving"
so it looks like it is in 3 sections. On the first one, "WARNER
BROS." Appears, followed by the electric-letter "VITAPHONE" logo and
on section 3, "PICTURES". Below that is the copyright
information.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Series Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
white sign in the middle has the words "LOONEY TUNES" and in black,
"A HUGH HARMAN-RUDOLF ISING PRODUCTION" below that. Below the sign in
small letters are the words "LEON SCHLESINGER, PRODUCER". Holding up
the sign is Bosko, a Mickey Mouse-type character who was WB's current
star at the time. Poking out from behind the sign and standing around
the logo are stereotypical 30s cartoon animals.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">End Title</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Bosko stands in front of a sign saying "A LOONEY TUNE" and says "So
Long, Folks!" Below it, in black, are the words "A HUGH HARMAN-RUDOLF
ISING PRODUCTION", and "Licensed under BRAY-HURD patents".</FONT>

On a curtain backdrop to the right, WB's newest (and admittedly
crappiest) cartoon star, Buddy, appears, holding his left hand up
Vanna White-style. On the upper left side of the screen the words
"LOONEY TUNES" appear and below Buddy and the curtain the words
"PRODUCED BY LEON SCHLESINGER" appear.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1935-1937)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Studio Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
At the top of the screen, curved, the word "VITAPHONE" appears in the
same electric letter font used previously, and on the very bottom is
the word "Presents" in script, followed by the copyright info. The
background is similar to a ship's porthole. And the WB Shield's most
famous role is cemented-it zooms in from a long distance in the
center of the screen to a huge size.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Variant</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: For
the very first cartoons using the "porthole", a logo similar to LT
logo 1 appears, but the "WARNER BROS. PICTURES" line is shortened to
only "WARNER BROS." With "PRODUCTIONS CORPORATION" underneath it,
then the "&amp; The Vitaphone Corporation" line.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Series Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Using the same porthole background, in the center, "LOONEY TUNES"
appears. The Beans Gang, WB's current stars, appear around it (When
Porky became the LT star, this was altered accordingly to feature
him). Below "LOONEY TUNES", "PRODUCED BY LEON SCHLESINGER"
appears.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">End Title</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
black screen with "LOONEY TUNES" curved at the top-left with
"PRODUCED BY LEON SCHLESINGER" on the bottom-right. "RELEASED BY
WARNER BROS. PRODUCTIONS CORP." is at the very bottom, and at the
center, the world-famous "That's All Folks!" logo appears.</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
music used for the previous logo was used at the beginning, but later
on a "naval-like" flute theme is used.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
"writing on" of the "That's All Folks!", the infamous "zooming
shield".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Can be seen on a few Beans' Gang LT shorts and the early Porky
shorts.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1937-1943)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Studio Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Against a background of musical notes, the WB shield zooms in with
"VITAPHONE" above and "PRESENTS" below. Later on, "VITAPHONE" is
changed to "WARNER BROS." And "Presents" is changed to
"Present".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Series Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"LOONEY TUNES" is curved near the top, with "PRODUCED BY LEON
SCHESINGER" at the bottom. Porky Pig assumes a similar pose as Buddy
did in Logo 3, and is on the left.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">End Title</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
same black screen as above until Bob Clampett's redesign of Porky
Pig. Afterwards, his place in world history is assured as he bursts
out of a drum saying his famous "Th-Th-Th-That's All Folks!" line. On
the top of the drum is "LOONEY TUNES" and below it is "PRODUCED BY
LEON SCHLESINGER". At the bottom is "RELEASED THRU WARNER BROS.
PICTURES".</FONT></P>

colorized.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1943-1963)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Studio Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Similar to the previous logos, only now the famous "Circles/Bullseye"
backdrop that has become a trademark of Warner Bros. Is in place.
Below the "WARNER BROS.", "PICTURES INC." is added. And now the
shield has its sound effect-the famous "twanging" sound created by
Treg Brown.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Series Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Above the "bullseye" and on the same background, "LOONEY TUNES"
appears in its now-distinctive font. Below it appears "PRODUCED BY
LEON SCHLESINGER." In 1944, this was changed to "A WARNER BROS.
CARTOON".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">End Titles</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Until 1945, the "Porky In A Drum" closing was used, however on some
Bugs Bunny cartoons a variant was used where Bugs said "And That's
The End!" while sitting in the open drum and munching on a carrot.
Starting in 1944, the "LEON SCHLESINGER" text was changed to "A
WARNER BROS. CARTOON". In 1945, a new closing was used. It started
with the "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">That's All,
Folks</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">!" script being written out, and then
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">LOONEY TUNES</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">" appearing at the top, curved as in the "black screen"
logo. Near the bottom, either the Leon Schlesinger text/Released by
WB combo was used (1943-44) or "A WARNER BROS. CARTOON" (1944-1963)
was used. The background was the circles/bullseye used in the Studio
Logo. The colors of the backdrop vary by year, but a list of the
colors would be too long to put here. Instead, check out Dave
Mackey's site </FONT><FONT

FACE="Arial">.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Variations</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
There were many variations to this logo, and here are some of
them:</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The most famous one of these, with Bugs
   Bunny relaxing on top of the shield as it zooms in. He chomps on
   his carrot for a few seconds, looks annoyed at the "camera", and
   then "pulls down" (like a curtain) the next logo, the Looney Tunes
   logo.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The shield fades into the character
   featured in the coming short. This was used mostly on Bugs Bunny
   cartoons, although other characters (Porky and Daffy, only Daffy,
   and only Porky) were used as well.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Some Looney Tunes were re-released as "Blue
   Ribbon" Merrie Melodies and lost their title cards. These
   re-releases kept the Looney Tunes music so it is painfully easy to
   spot former LTs that were reissued as Merrie Melodies.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Used on "Lumberjack Rabbit" only, the
   shield zooms in like normal, but overshoots its mark, crashing
   into the screen, before settling into the usual position. The
   reason for this was that the cartoon was originally produced in
   3D, and this was Warner's most effective (and pretty much only, as
   the film made no good use of the 3D effect) use of the
   medium.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
distinctive Looney Tunes theme, "The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down" is
introduced. In the 1950s, this theme is shortened somewhat.</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
"zooming shield".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Check Cartoon Network, this is on most of the Looney Tunes
shown.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
High, mainly for the zooming shield and its VERY scary "TWANG!" sound
effect.</FONT></P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">7th Logo</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1963-1967)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Studio Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Completely different. Several series of lines come from the center of
the screen, 3 </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#800080">purple</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">, one </FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFF00">yellow</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">, with 2
of the </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800080">purple</FONT><FONT

COLOR="#800080">purple</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> ones vertical, and
the </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFF00">yellow</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"> one horizontal. The </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFF00">yellow</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> line moves up and
down as the </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#800080">purple</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> lines disappear and
an abstract "WB", with the W made up of 2 triangles and the B made up
of two semicircles, appears. The </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFF00">yellow</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> line turns into the
word "PRESENTS" over the abstract WB.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Series Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: 2
lines from the center of the screen slide away to reveal a strange
series logo. On the top is "LOONEY TUNES" in a weird font and on the
bottom-right "A WARNER BROS. CARTOON" appears in a rectangle in that
same font. Below the rectangle is the word "TECHNICOLOR". To the left
of the rectangle is a bannerless WB shield. The lines then come back,
slide back into each other, wiping away the text, and then "swirl"
into the black background.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Early Variant</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
For the first cartoons with this logo, this text is on a white
background with no WB shield. The sliding apart lines and the studio
logo are still on a white background.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">End Title</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
abstract WB appears piece-by-piece, and "A WARNER BROS. CARTOON" is
wiped onto the screen. When the wiping gets to the "</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFF00">OO</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" in
"CARTOON", the Os turn </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFF00">yellow</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> and "pop out" of the
logo, then pop back into the logo, like two eyes doing a take. "N" is
then wiped on and "A VITAPHONE RELEASE" and/or "A VITAGRAPH RELEASE"
appear.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A weird
version of "The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down". The end titles originally
used bells chiming when the WB appears, and then a honking sound for
the OO animation.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The "lines", really bad music and animation.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Seen on most mid-to-late 60s Looney Tunes on Cartoon Network.</FONT>

Medium, the music sucks and the animation is choppy. Also the
abstract WB is creepy.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(1967-1969)</FONT></P>

The same as the previous logo, but the background is now </FONT><FONT

now </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF80C0">pink</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">. The 3 </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFF00">yellow</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> lines now disappear
at the same time, as the shield appears and the W7 logo "draws"
itself in. The horizontal line animation is the same.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Series Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Again, same as last time, only the WB shield is dropped. The
rectangle is now centered and reads "A WARNER BROS.-SEVEN ARTS
CARTOON".</FONT></P>

Same as last logo, although the "A WARNER BROS.- CARTOON" line is
changed to add in the Seven Arts information and the abstract WB is
replaced by the W7 logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Color</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: At

more of a dark red color on occasion.</FONT></P>

Quite rare; WB's cartoon output was coming to a stop by this time.
But it is still saved on shorts whenever shown, but they are
notoriously bad, so they aren't shown on the AOL networks
often.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
A bit better, getting rid of the abstract WB and cleaning up the
animation a bit.</FONT></P>
