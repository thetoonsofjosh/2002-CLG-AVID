<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Tandem Productions</B></font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1970-1982)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Tandem Productions never had a
real on-screen logo. In the ending credits of shows like All in
the Family and Sanford and Son, the text would scroll up at the
end:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A</font><br>
<font face="Arial">BUD YORKIN</font><br>
<font face="Arial">NORMAN LEAR</font><br>
<font face="Arial">TANDEM PRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">For shows that premiered after 1978, such
as &quot;Diff'rent Strokes,&quot; it would simply read:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A</font><br>
<font face="Arial">TANDEM PRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None, it's an in-credit logo</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Closing theme from specific
show</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Common, still seen on
any show produced by Tandem, such as &quot;All in the Family&quot;,
&quot;Good Times&quot;, &quot;Maude&quot;, and &quot;Sanford and
Son&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>T.A.T Communications Co.</B></font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1975-1982)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The same thing went with T.A.T.Communications,
which produced &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; and &quot;One Day at a
Time&quot; among others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: It would just say:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A</font><br>
<font face="Arial">T.A.T. COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY</font><br>
<font face="Arial">PRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">But on One Day at a Time, it would read:</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Arial">A</font><br>
<font face="Arial">NORMAN LEAR</font><br>
<font face="Arial">T.A.T. COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY</font><br>
<font face="Arial">PRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>TAT?</u>: T.A.T. stood for a Yiddish
phrase pronounced &quot;Tokas-adamn-tokin,&quot; which meant
&quot;Putting one's butt on the line.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None, it's an in-credit logo</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Closing theme from specific
show</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Uncommon, still seen
on reruns of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; and &quot;One Day at a
Time&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>P*I*T*S Films</B></font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1978-1982)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Against a blue background
reads the following text:</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">DISTRIBUTED BY</font><font
face="Arial"> (in white)</font><br>
<font color="#00FF00" size="4" face="Arial">P I T S </font><font
face="Arial">(larger, and in green)</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">FILMS</font><font face="Arial">
(normal size, in white)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">And in the three spaces of the letters come
some white stars, one by one, that seem to be &quot;coming at
you,&quot; and then settle in their spaces. As it fades out, it
reads:</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">DISTRIBUTED BY</font><font
face="Arial"> (in white)</font><br>
<font color="#00FF00" size="4" face="Arial">P*I*T*S </font><font
face="Arial">(larger, and in green, but the stars are white)</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">FILMS</font><font face="Arial">
(normal size, in white)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The stars &quot;growing&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Very high. The entire
logo is done with cheap chyron, and the stars look terrible.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A weird synth tune that
ascends and descends repeatedly, ending in a strange fanfare.
This tune was composed by John Maxwell Anderson, famous for
producing 'Who's The Boss?&quot;, &quot;Different Strokes&quot;,
and &quot;Married....With Children&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: As rare as they get
without being extinct. It showed up recently on a rerun of &quot;Good
Times&quot; on TBS (the 1978 episode &quot;JJ the Teacher&quot;).
It is rumored to still appear on reruns of GT and Sanford &amp;
Son in the Chicagoland area. Otherwise expect to see the ever-popular
Boxes of Boredom at the end of your favorite Norman Lear series.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: The music can scare
many people, but it's mostly just annoying.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>TOY Productions</B></font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1977-1982)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">TOY Productions was a partnership between
TV producers Saul Turteltaub, Bernie Orenstein, and Bud Yorkin.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: A ball with the stylized text:
TOY in it, and under it the text:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">TOY PRODUCTIONS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It scrolls in with the credits of a show,
much like the Tandem Productions credit. Sometimes the empty
space is colored in a very tacky shade of orange.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variant:</u> An animation rendition of
this logo consists of the round ball, and the T and Y sliding
from the left and right side of the ball. The O pops in
afterward, right before the company name zooms in from the bottom
of the screen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None, it's a still in-credit
logo</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Closing theme of show.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Rare; the only show I
know of where it appeared was &quot;What's Happening&quot; during
the 1977-78 and 1978-79 seasons. It is still seen there as it is
attached to the credits. The animated version was seen on the
short-lived 1981 NBC sitcom &quot;Me and the Boys&quot; with
Mickey Rooney.</font></p>
