<hr>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">1st Logo</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">(Dates unknown, though the
logos were seen in the '50s and '60s)</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>:
&quot;AAP&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>History</u> - &quot;What
Was AAP?&quot;: For that answer we turn to some
rec.arts.animation posts.....</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>From Thomas Reed</u>: I
believe it served the same purpose as Movietime and National
Telefilm Associates (NTA) served for live action films.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">See, back in the early
50's, it was considered &quot;shameful&quot; by the movie studios
to have their real studio names on films run on television. Movie
studios saw themselves in a death struggle with the boob tube,
and to actually release anything to television with the studios'
real logos was treason to the movie industry.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">So, the studios only
released their pre-1948 movies to TV (this being the date when
studios were forced to dump their ownership of movie theaters,
which is somehow legally important to the issue). And they had
NTA and Movietime put their logos on the movie - sometimes even
covering up the studio copyright notice inside the movie's
credits.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Brian adds</u>: A.A.P.
was the company that purchased the rights to the Paramount POPEYE
cartoons and the pre-1948 color Warner Bros. cartoons, to sell
them to television in the 1950s. While most of these packages
were sold to local TV stations, arrangements were also made with
different companies and ad agencies to sponsor the programs on a
regional or national basis.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">When A.A.P. purchased the
cartoons, the familiar A.A.P. leader was added when new negative
prints were struck for distribution.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>And Jerry Beck says</u>:
A.A.P. was absorbed by United Artists in the late 1950s (The
library included ALL WB shorts (including live action) and the WB
pre 1950 feature films. Turner purchased this library along with
the pre-1985 MGM library from MGM/UA. What's funny is that no on
has ever removed those titles from the prints -- many at UA and
now Turner believe the A.A.P. titles ARE the original titles! I
love that Fred Ladd colorized the A.A.P. logo on the Popeye
cartoons -- it's ridiculous!</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: The initials
&quot;a.a.p.&quot; appear in lowercase, with the &quot;p&quot;
having a very long stem. Alongside the &quot;p's&quot; stem the
words &quot;ASSOCIATED ARTISTS PRODUCTIONS INC.&quot; appear, and
below all that is the word &quot;Presents&quot; written in
cursive. At the end of a short, the logo appears with the
following message above it: &quot;This picture has been presented
by&quot; Also, the full name of the company appears horizontally
under the initials, with a space where the &quot;p's&quot; stem
is.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: None, it's a
still logo</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: Some
of the colors they used for the logo when colorizing the Popeye
shorts.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: The beginning
or end of the music in whatever short has the logo, depending on
where the logo appears.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Can
still be seen on the Fleischer Popeye shorts when they're seen on
Cartoon Network.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Arial">(Note: See the </font><a
href="#2"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Arial">Availability
section</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Arial"> on
the 2nd logo for other details)</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low,
pretty innocuous being a still logo and all. If the short uses
dramatic music when it comes up, though, that may make one a
little antsy.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">2nd Logo</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">(Dates unknown, though the
logos were seen in the '50s and '60s)</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>:
&quot;AAP,&quot; &quot;That logo at the beginning of Popeye and
Looney Tunes&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Kind of a more
three-dimensional look compared to the first. The blue background
has a bumpy look to it, and the logo itself (which is basically
the same as #1) is yellow and 3D. In the opening, the initials
back away a bit, and then the words &quot;Associated Artists
Productions presents&quot; appear, along with characters from
whatever short is coming up (either Popeye or Warner Bros.) The
ending is the same as the first, except the placement of the
company's name is different (it appears on two lines at the left
of the &quot;p's&quot; stem. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>More Background</u>: It
should be noted that the AAP logo was dubbed onto shorts for
presentation on television; however, where they usually mask the
Paramount logos completely for Popeye, you still see the WB
shield opening on the WB shorts. Also, some Famous Studios Popeye
shorts made it to TV with the Paramount ID intact. Why all this
happens is explained here by Dave Mackey (from
rec.arts.animation):</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">When Paramount sold off
their shorts to television, there was a stipulation that all
references to Paramount be removed. The pre-1950 cartoons
including the Fleischers were sold to an outfit called UM&amp;M
TV Corp., and they too do not have Paramount logos.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">However, there are a few
Popeye cartoons from 1956-1957 that were never released with AAP
titles because they were released after AAP's acquisition of the
earlier titles. More recently some older cartoons have had their
print material upgraded to original-title versions, possibly done
by current rights-holder Turner Entertainment Corp., who acquired
the cartoons when it bought the MGM/UA library.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">That's [WB keeping its
logos on the shorts] more a function of Warner Bros.' reissuing
the cartoons as Blue Ribbon Specials. AAP did not touch the end
titles of the Warner Bros. cartoons. Apparently, Warner Bros. had
no such stipulation that their logos be removed when AAP sent the
cartoons into television in the late 1950's. When originally
theatrically issued, EVERY Looney Tunes release from about 1937
through the mid-1940's ended with Porky Pig's signoff. They
experimented with a Bugs signoff for a brief while until 1945,
when beginning with &quot;Acrobatty Bunny&quot; they went to an
instrumental end title with no character signoff.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>FX/Cheesy Factor</u>:
The backing letters.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Like Logo #1,
it's music related to the short; in the case of Popeye, it's the
beginning of his theme (Famous Studios era). For WB, it's the
Looney Tunes theme. The ending logo is used for the Popeye shorts
only, and the music is an abridged version of &quot;Popeye the
Sailor Man.&quot;</font></p>

<p><a name="2"></a><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>:
You may still see this logo when Cartoon Network shows Popeye or
Looney Tunes shorts. However, CN is currently attempting to
restore many shorts, meaning the return of their original logos
rather than the AAP ones. So it may not be as available as it
once was. You may still see the logo if any other stations are
still showing Popeye or WB cartoons.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Well I
used to find the moving letters weird, but your mileage may vary
on that one. It also depends again on the music being used; for
example, if the WB shield's &quot;BOWWWWW!&quot; sound effect
scared you, chances are you wouldn't like it here either.</font></p>
