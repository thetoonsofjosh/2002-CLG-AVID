<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>Background</u>:
This company is still alive, but mainly for Cannell's work as a
novelist. The logo has not been used on a original show since
1998, when Silk Stalkings ended its long run on the USA Network.
There is still possibilities that the logo will be used on an
original project in the future, namely a movie version of Hunter
or The A-Team. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Guy
on Typewriter&quot;, &quot;Cannell&quot;, &quot;The Evil
Typewriter Man!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: A live-action
man (Mr. Stephen J. Cannell himself) with a pompadour and a beard
is typing at a typewriter in an office/study area with
bookshelves and awards galore. The camera then pans clockwise
from his face to his back. Once the camera is towards Cannell's
back, he throws the paper he is typing on over his head. The
paper becomes animated on a black background, and floats
downwards towards a stack of animated papers below. The paper
&quot;scoops&quot; up the top papers in the stack and forms a
&quot;C&quot;. The text &quot;Stephen J. Cannell Productions&quot;
or &quot;Cannell Entertainment Inc.&quot; is seen above.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>Variants</u>:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the early
        years, we just see Stephen typing at the typewriter from
        the front, he throws the paper up into the air, and the
        animation sequence continues as usual.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Occasionally,
        after Mr. Cannell throws the paper, we bypass the
        animation and turn to a black static screen that says
        &quot;Produced by Cannell Entertainment Inc.&quot; The 20th
        Century Fox ID (Cannell's parent company) would follow.
        This was seen on some episodes of Silk Stalkings (era
        unknown).</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Of course,
        this logo was updated often, the main difference is with
        Mr. Cannell wearing different clothes, possibly new
        awards in the office added as well, and even different
        offices were used. The concept was always the same, as
        well as the animation. A list of outfits can be seen
        below.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On some (maybe
        all) episodes of Renegade, the text above the finished
        logo says &quot;Renegade IV Productions&quot;, the live
        action sequence is intact.</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>Outfit List</u>:
Here is a list of outfits worn by Mr. Cannell over the years:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">1980: Steve
        has a dark colored sweater with white collar shirt, plus
        he is smoking his pipe</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">1983: Steve
        has a blue jacket and white flannel shirt over a black
        turtleneck, plus he is smoking his pipe</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">1984: Steve
        has a black jacket and dark colored sweater over white
        collar shirt</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">1985: Steve
        in white striped flannel shirt</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">1987: Steve
        in casual black-and-white vest</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">1989: Steve
        in red polo shirt (with the collar up)</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>SFX/Cheesy Factor</u>:
The animation used to &quot;turn&quot; the &quot;real&quot; paper
into an animated one can be tacky to some, although it is a great
transition</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A dramatic
tune is played while Cannell types, which contains string-like
instruments and pounding synthesizers. The tone is more soothing
when Cannell throws the paper, reaching a climax with an wind
instrument (probably a flute). When the &quot;C&quot; forms, a
Malibu-style guitar is played. In the logo's early days, ominous
horns and flutes played along with the pounding synthesizers
while Cannell types.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Still
saved on Cannell's shows when reran, such as Hunter on TBS and
The A-Team on TNN.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>:
Median, the music is quite dramatic. The animation looks a little
creepy to some. And Mr. Cannell himself doesn't look like the
nicest guy in the world here.</font></p>
