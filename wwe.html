<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial">World Wrestling
Federation/Entertainment (WWF/WWE)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial">Compiled by James

<hr color="#FF0000">

<p><font face="Arial">(1985-1987)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The Recognized
Symbol of Excellence&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Against a starry background
the two halves of the WWF logo come from the top and the bottom
of the screen with orange &quot;shadow&quot; effects, cross each
other's path, then merge to form an outline of the logo (which is
a stylized &quot;W&quot; that is &quot;divided&quot; to look like
two &quot;W's,&quot; and also has two protrusions at the upper
right for an &quot;F&quot;). Rainbow-colored lasers cross the
logo filling it with a gold color that turns silver after they're
gone. Beneath, the words &quot;WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION&quot;
fly inwards one by one from the bottom of the screen, in white
font and with the shadow effect. An announcer then says, &quot;The
recognized symbol of excellence in sports entertainment,&quot; as
the logo &quot;shines.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The flying words and logo
parts, the laser effects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The logo looks like
it's been &quot;plastered&quot; onto the background. Also, the
announcer uses an &quot;echo&quot; special effect to make him
sound omnipotent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: An '80s guitar-driven pop/rock
instrumental. Kind of something you'd expect to hear opening an
MTV program during that time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Seen on USA and
syndicated WWF shows of the time period. You may see it on an old
video.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low to Moderate.</font></p>

<hr color="#FF0000">

<p><font face="Arial">(1987-1989)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;What the World is
Watching&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: A silver-gray, three-dimensional
WWF logo with no details flies across a landscape of rivers and
mountains. It rises up, and the background is now an orange and
purple sky. Lightning strikes the logo, adding the silver
details, first to the first &quot;W,&quot; then the second, and
finally the &quot;F.&quot; An announcer says, &quot;The WWF.....what
the world is watching!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: More CGI-like animation, the
landscape and flying logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: More modern than the
previous logo, but the omnipotent echo effect for the announcer
is still there. Even funnier to hear Mean Gene be given the
&quot;voice of God&quot; treatment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music/Sound</u>: A guitar-driven, more
imposing hard rock instrumental. The voiceover was done by the
WWF's interview man at the time, &quot;Mean&quot; Gene Okerlund.
Howard Finkel, the WWF's ring announcer, also did the voice over
at one time</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Was used for WWF shows
at the time, both syndicated and on USA, as well as WWF pay-per-views.
You may still see it on some old tapes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Moderate, may be a bit
more intimidating because of the lightning and the like.</font></p>

<hr color="#FF0000">

<p><font face="Arial">(1989-1990)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: A two-second &quot;static shot&quot;
of the WWF logo against the orange and purple sky (from the
&quot;What the World is Watching&quot; logo)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None, note the &quot;static
shot&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Start of opening theme</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Seen on WWF
programming at the time</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low</font></p>

<hr color="#FF0000">

<p><font face="Arial">(Any logo used between these logos are
currently being described and will be seen soon)</font></p>

<hr color="#FF0000">

<p><font face="Arial">(April 1998-April 2002)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Attitude&quot;,
&quot;The seizure inducing WWF logo&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: This one is hard to describe--
many scenes of crowds, fireworks, and &quot;tough&quot; scenes
are alternated. on most of these, &quot;#1 Worldwide Leader&quot;,
&quot;World&quot;, &quot;Wrestling&quot;, &quot;Federation&quot;,
and other stuff like that are seen (the words &quot;World
Wrestling Federation&quot; are not seen at the same time). The
animation abruptly ends and &quot;ATTITUDE&quot; is seen for a
fraction of a second, followed by a quick pan of the current WWF
logo (much like the original, but it seems like a 5-year old's
scribble of the logo). The WWF logo is stylized to have a harder
edge, like their product, and is modeled after the Nike &quot;whoosh&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The quick cuts and quick
animation of the words on the scenes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Synthesized &quot;noise&quot;
that culminates in a thunderclap-like sound.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Outside of tapes, is
extinct, due to WWF changing their company name to WWE, their new
logo (to be described soon) is very similar to this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Median, the noise and
&quot;Thunderclap&quot; might not sit well with everyone.</font></p>

<hr color="#FF0000">

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">Coliseum Video/WWF</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1987-????)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The Cube&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a space background are the
words &quot;COLISEUM VIDEO PRESENTS,&quot; seen near the top.
Below it is a three-panelled &quot;wall,&quot; the first and
third panels of which have wrestling action inside. The middle
one has the &quot;Recognized Symbol of Excellence&quot; WWF logo.
The words disappear and the panel flies up, and then down and
towards the screen, where it takes a more cube-like shape. It
starts spinning around and you see the following images:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">1) The WWF logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">2) Ricky Steamboat vs. Randy Savage from
WrestleMania III</font><br>
<font face="Arial">3) The Can-Am Connection vs. Don Muraco and
Bob Orton from WMIII</font><br>
<font face="Arial">4) On a pink background the words &quot;WWF
OFFICIAL HOME VIDEO SERIES&quot;</font><br>
<font face="Arial">5) Tito Santana vs. Randy Savage</font><br>
<font face="Arial">6) Hart Foundation vs. Killer Bees</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This sequence repeats 3 times until the
cube turns back to the WWF logo for a fourth time, then the cube
rolls away, leading to the video's title screen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor/SFX</u>: The cube is
clearly a product of '80s animation</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Starts imposing, then mellows
out with a saxophone theme. This theme is also used on the title
screen of the original Nintendo Entertainment System &quot;Wrestlemania&quot;
game.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Can be seen on &quot;Piledriver:
The Music Video&quot; and presumably other videos from the time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Not very scary.</font></p>

<hr color="#FF0000">

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">The Wrestling Network</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1987-88)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;TWN&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: The logo spirals to the middle
of the screen, against a blue background with a red-black-red
center (meant to look like an abstract shading, I guess). It is a
white &quot;TWN&quot; where all the letters are joined together
and the last two are sort-of divided by a star-shaped hole.
Underneath in blocky letters are the words &quot;THE WRESTLING
NETWORK.&quot; The words &quot;DISTRIBUTED BY&quot; fade above
the logo, and the copyright date underneath.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The &quot;spiraling.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: With the &quot;shadows&quot;
effect, it reeks of '80s computer animation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Usually the closing theme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Seen on syndicated NWA
(which would be replaced in 1990 by WCW) programs of the time.
TWN was the name for the &quot;alliance&quot; between the NWA (National
Wrestling Alliance) and the Universal Wrestling Federation, an
independent promotion. Eventually, the UWF was taken over totally
by the NWA, but the TWN name stuck throughout 1988. In any event,
you probably will never see this logo again, unless you know
someone who has videos of these shows.</font></p>
