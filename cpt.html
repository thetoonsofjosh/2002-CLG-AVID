FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">: Against a red background, the letters
"C-P-T" appear one by one. They are all yellow, and as the picture
moves outward, each initial appears on screen. The "T" is in the
middle of and on a higher plane than the "C" and "P," which slide
upwards diagonally to merge with the "T" to form a stylized logo,
which looks like a pretzel. On either side of the logo's stem are the
words "COLUMBIA" and "PICTURES," and below that "TELEVISION." Under
all that is the message, "A DIVISION OF COLUMBIA PICTURES INDUSTRIES
INC."</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">Music</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">: An abridged version of the Screen Gems
'65-'74 theme. The three opening notes bring forth the three initials
in the logo, and appear to be played faster than on the SG
version.</FONT></P>

"The Starburst", "The TorchBurst"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">: We see a bright torch light, as if in
sunburst, appear against a black screen and as it shrinks, it changes
into a more "abstract" torch light: an orange half circle, or a
semicircle, with thirteen white rays in the center and the words
"Columbia Pictures Television" under it. The entire logo then slowly
backs away as it fades out. This logo is actually the second half of
the Columbia Pictures movie logo, and aside from a different color
for the abstract torch, the footage also seems to be played faster
than it is in the movies.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">Urban Legend</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">: It is rumored that "A Unit of the
Coca-Cola Company" was seen at some point on the Sunburst logo. Many
members of CLG have thought they saw the Coca-Cola info at some
point, but no video evidence has been found yet. The dates are quite
questionable, and Coca-Cola may have used the Sunburst for
distribution only. It is said that this was used on What's Happening
reruns during the mid 80s and spring 1982 episodes of "The Young and
the Restless."</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">SFX</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">: The sunburst shrinking and turning
into the abstract torch. Nice effects, but are even better when
combined with the Torch Lady in the movies.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">Music</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">: The television theme is a variation of
the theatrical inspirational music. Was also written by Susanne
Ciani. In an interesting note, some people find it appropriate for
the company that would be owned by Coca-Cola, as the effects in the
song resemble the sound of pouring and fizzing soda.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">Music
Variation</FONT></U><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">:
Some syndicated showings of this logo have a shorter version of the
music, only playing the second half.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">: As with other Columbia logos, it will
be hard to find because of the editing habits of Sony. However, it
still turns up every so often: at least one episode of Witt-Thomas'
"Soap" on Comedy Central kept the logo, and local stations may have
older prints of programs such as Spelling-Goldberg's "Charlie's
Angels" with it intact. It has also been spotted on UK prints of
"Fantasy Island," followed by the Columbia TriStar International
Television logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">: We see the standard Columbia Pictures
logo, the lady holding a light torch on top of a pedestal, in her
1980s incarnation, resembling Da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The words
"Columbia Pictures" appear on either side of the torch lady, the word
"Television" underneath, and underneath that, either "A Unit of The
Coca-Cola Company" (with Coca-Cola in their logo font) or sometimes
nothing at all. The woman's torch "shines" after the music
ends.</FONT></P>

higher pitched version of the Sunburst music was used. In late 1987,
when the byline changed from Coca-Cola to CPE, the music was changed
to a 6-note horn-driven jingle.</FONT><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FF8000"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">Also
consider that Columbia's logo editing habits were so sloppy during
this era that sometimes this logo was plastered over a Screen Gems or

plastered itself to all old Columbia logos, but it just might pop up
on some older prints of shows. When USA reran "My Two Dads" recently,
this logo was intact on most episodes. Comedy Central's print of the
movie "Hairspray" used the 7th variation listed in the opening (w/the
87-92 jingle).</FONT></P>

Columbia Pictures logo, a woman (Columbia, a representation of the
USA, also rumored to be resembling actress Annette Benning) holding a
light torch on top of a pedestal. The word "Columbia" appears in
large, silver letters behind her at the very top, similar to the
classic Columbia Pictures logo of the 1930s-1970s. Underneath the

full of brass instruments.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF8000">Availability</FONT></U><FONT

current shows and reruns. Can be seen occasionally on older prints on

you'll see the Columbia TriStar logo.</FONT></P>
