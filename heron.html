<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial">Heron
Communications</font> </p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Written and Compiled by Matt
Williams, Nicholas Aczel &amp; Cameron McCaffrey</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Hi-Tops Video</b></font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1985-1992)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a gray background, a red
stylized drawing of a shoe appears, without the shoelaces. Then,
white &quot;shoelaces&quot; appear at the bottom and begin to
slowly make their way up the shoe, culminating in a nice big bow
when the shoe is completely tied. The shoe zooms out, and the
words &quot;HI-TOPS VIDEO&quot; appear in black in the
&quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken&quot; font, followed by &quot;A
Heron Communications Company&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The tying of the shoe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The animation used
for the tying of the shoe is pretty low-tech and primitive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Very loud and bouncy
synthesized music score.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Originally appeared on
&quot;My Pet Monster&quot;, later Heron releases of Charlie Brown
specials, and lots of other children's videos.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, the animation is
choppy, and the music is cheap, but nothing scary here </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Media Home Entertainment</b></font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">1st Logo</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Arial"><b><br>
</b></font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">(1978-1981)</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Nickname:</u>
&quot;MEDA&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Logo:</u> On a twinkling
space background, the dark blue stylized word &quot;MEDA&quot;
lights up ala a pink outline. The logo glitters three times
in-sync with the fanfare, then a glitter appears below the logo
and flies across the screen writing the words &quot;Media Home
Entertainment Inc.&quot; in similar font and coloring. The logo
glitters some more and briefly flashes pink. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>SFX:</u> The
lighting/glittering effects, the glitter writing.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor:</u> Off
the scale. The space background looks like something out of a
hand-drawn animated cartoon, the pink-on-blue lettering is gaudy,
and the glitter---yecch!</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Music:</u> A very
dramatic orchestral fanfare.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Availability:</u>
Extinct, apart from the occasional old prints circulating in used
video stores. This was used on the very first Media Home
Entertainment tapes but quickly replaced with the 2<sup>nd</sup>
logo. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor:</u>
Median, the dramatic fanfare and bad animation will probably get
on more than a few nerves, though it would get much worse when
the font changed....</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1981-1987)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The Space Logo&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a space background, 2
outlines of the word &quot;MEDIA&quot; begin to move towards each
other from opposite sides of the screen (one on top and one on
bottom), in a very odd font and styled so that it looks somewhat
like this:</font><br>
<font face="Arial">__MEDIA__</font><br>
<font face="Arial">With the first line connecting to the
&quot;M&quot;, and the second connecting to the &quot;A&quot;.
The two words continue their move towards each other, and when
they meet, there is a very large flash as the outline(s) rotate
backwards, so that we see a little of the logo's bottom. The
flash subsides and the whole logo is filled in with chrome.
&quot;MEDIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT, INC.&quot;, in black but glowing
blue, zooms in from the center of the screen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Byline</u>: Beginning in 1984, &quot;A
HERON COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY&quot; zooms in from the center below
the Media line.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The outline, the space
background (which actually looks quite realistic for its time)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The animation is
primitive and the zooming in words are extremely cheesy, but
definitely not as bad as some logos of the time.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A very dramatic orchestral
fanfare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Pretty rare nowadays,
as videos from this company have long been out of print.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: High due to the
fanfare, outlines, Media font, and bright flash. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1987-1992)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black BG, several sets of
bar segments move up from the bottom of the screen at an angle.
As we rotate towards the front, we see that the bars are forming
the Media logo, similar to the one in Logo 1. After the logo is
fully formed, the chrome fades in, and &quot;A Heron
Communications Company&quot; appears underneath.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Fox Video Connection?</u>: Their very
last releases went through Fox Video. The above logo would play
as normal, but there would be an announcer saying &quot;Media
Home Entertainment in association with Fox Video!&quot; When the
announcer got to the Fox Video part of that, Fox Video logo 1
played.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The forming of the word
&quot;MEDIA&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A low-key synth theme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Again, rare, seeing as
most of the videos it released have been re-released by New Line
or Anchor Bay.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low.</font> </p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong>The Nostalgia Merchant</strong></font><font
face="Arial"><br>
(1980's, exact dates unknown) &nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo:</u> On a space background with
white, red and orange stars, we see an object zooming towards the
center of the screen from the top. It rotates into the middle to
reveal that it is the &quot;Nostalgia Merchant&quot; logo, a
yellow circle with a large light blue square overlapping it, all
of this being covered by a white border. Inside the yellow circle
is the black word &quot;ThE&quot; in a font somewhat resembling
the Freehand591 BT font, and &quot;NOSTALGIA MERCHANT&quot; in
red with a black outline in a font that resembles the Comicraft
fonts &quot;That's All Folks&quot; and &quot;Too Much
Cappucino.&quot; Below, the words</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">A Division of<br>
MEDIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT, INC.<br>
A Heron International Company &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">fade in. &nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX/Cheesy Factor:</u> The logo zooming
towards the center and the words fading in, which both look very
80's. &nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music:</u> A very memorable and
well-done orchestral piece that fits the logo very nicely. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability:</u> Rather hard to find,
as Nostalgia Merchant tapes have been out of print for a while
now. Your best bets would be either E-Bay or old mom-and-pop
video stores. &nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor:</u> The logo might
surprise the first time you see it, but it's harmless. &nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Note:</u> I'm having trouble with the
exact dates this logo was around. If anyone knows, please drop me
a line at </font><a href="mailto:camy123@aol.com"
