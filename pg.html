1st Logo<BR>

(Used on Another World, more variations will come soon)<BR>

(1970s?-1984)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">: Superimposed logo, consisting of the
words A PRESENTATION OF PROCTER AND GAMBLE PRODUCTIONS in Lydian
font, centered inside a wreath of interlocking circles (in the same
motif as the open to the show in that period). </FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">SFX</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">: None, it's superimposed </FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">Music</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">: The Another World closing theme
</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">: Was only used in the end credits of
Another World, when they bothered to run them, from at least the
mid-1970s to 1981. </FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">: Low; if the Another World
"kaleidoscope wreath" open bothered you, this may be scary as well,
but being superimposed, it's fairly tame.</FONT></P>

2nd Logo<BR>

(1985-)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">: "PGP"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">: A group of multifaceted rays in
varying shades of blue rises up from bottom screen. The rays form a
monolith with a bright, shiny back face, which pans backward (and
slightly downward), rotates to face forward, then stops. The rays
then pull back to form the letters "PGP" in a lined font, and letters
shine in a "flash". After that, the words "PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE
PRODUCTIONS, INC." (in white Avant Garde font) appear below the
"PGP", and are bordered top and bottom by two blue lines (same color
as the PGP) which form left to right and right to left, respectively.
</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">SFX</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">: The blue rays, "blooming of light"
effect, but was very good quality CGI (for 1986, anyway). </FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">Music</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">: A light, jaunty synth tune, consisting
of 2 descending bars of 6 notes, then a last bar of 8 notes, then a 4
note sounder as the last bass chord fades away (i.e. just after the
rays in the PGP pull back). However, CBS in August 1999 replaced the
electronic music with generic network promo music. The generic music
has a quiet synthesizer and piano piece (d-f#-a-e'-d'). The music
accompanying the As The World Turns version of the short PGP is a
string-dominated pseudo-symphonic waltz (la-di-dah, di-dah,
di-dahhh).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">(Note: The most
common version just shows the flash and everything after, with the
4-note sounder as the music, which has a note sequence of
a-f#-d-g.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">This logo made its first end
credit appearances on the following Procter and Gamble shows around
the following dates:</FONT></P>

<OL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">Another World: Feb. 14,
   1985</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">As The World Turns: Fall
   1985</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">Search for Tomorrow: Feb.
   26, 1986</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">Guiding Light: Fall
   1986.</FONT>
</OL>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">Availability</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">: Found on episodes of Procter &amp;
Gamble soaps since about 1986, and on programs co-produced by P&amp;G
(such as Dawson's Creek). The long version is usually only used on
soaps and is a fairly uncommon find.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0080C0">: The short version would be low, but
the long version might be a bit higher, the synth theme is pretty
friendly, but the dramatics of the long version may get to some.
