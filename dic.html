Gadget&quot; custom logo<br>
(1983)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo:</u> Inspector Gadget passes a green DiC logo on a blue
background while on his skates. Halfway through, his Gadget
mallet comes out (presumably involuntarily) and hits the space
above the &quot;I,&quot; dotting it. Gadget exits out of control.<br>
<br>
<u>FX:</u> Just DiC quality animation<br>
<br>
<u>Music:</u> A trumpet outro from the end notes of the Inspector
Gadget theme song.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability:</u> Extinct, when this show is now rerun, it is
replaced by the Incredible World of DiC logo. <br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor:</u> Low, depends on what you think of the music
and the DiC logo&#146;s look. </font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">&quot;The Littles&quot;

(1983)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo:</u> The character Dinky runs past the green DiC logo on
an orange background and places a green button onto the space
above the &quot;i&quot;, dotting the letter.<br>
<br>
<u>FX:</u> Just DiC quality animation<br>
<br>
<u>Music:</u> The outro of The Littles' theme song.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability:</u> Extinct, when this show is now rerun, it is

and the look of the DiC logo.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">1st Standard Logo<br>
(1984-1987)<br>
<br>
<u>Nickname:</u> &quot;The Vortex&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo:</u> Background is a vortex of blue boxes, which purple
colors streak down as a green stylized &quot;DiC&quot; comes up,
seemingly sideways, then turning forward as it comes closer. When
it is all the way up, the logo shines and sparkles. <br>
<br>
<u>FX:</u> The blue vortex with purple streaking down it, the
zooming logo.<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor:</u> Early computer animation<br>
<br>
<u>Music:</u> An ascending 8-note synthesized theme<br>
<br>
<u>Go, Gadget:</u> On the 2nd season of the show (1984-85), a new
variant of this logo with an orange &#147;DiC&#148; was
introduced with a very different 6-note keyboard tune. The
&#147;orange&#148; logo was used intermittently with the
&#147;green&#148; one on 1985-87 DiC shows, but often used the
8-note music instead.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability:</u> Unfortunately, none of the shows that had
this logo (Inspector Gadget, Zoobilee Zoo, Heathcliff and the
Catillac Cats to name a few) are currently being rerun on TV, so
it&#146;s pretty much gone outside of tapes. But if the shows are
rerun in the future, expect the Incredible World of DiC to
plaster it.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor:</u> Minimal, the music may scare some but the
logo is probably more ugly than scary. However, it would get much
worse with the follow-up&#133;</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1987-2001, 2003-)<br>
<br>
<u>Nicknames:</u> &quot;Kid In Bed&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo:</u> We see a boy sleeping in bed (a dog is on the bed,
too) with a window above. The camera pans through the bedroom to
a &quot;spiked&quot; star outside the window. The spiked star
morphs into a ball, and the silver, 3-D word &quot;DIC&quot;
zooms in and rotates 90º below to face us. The ball is the dot
in the &#147;I&#148; in &#147;DIC.&#148; Then, a kid will say the
company's name (pronounced &quot;DEEK&quot;) and in some cases is
silent. In a rare variation, a light, whispery choir will sing
&quot;DIC&quot; instead of the usual kid voiceover. <br>
<br>
<u>FX:</u> The pan from bed to star, the chroma key used to place
the CGI animations in the window. Actually pretty high-tech for
it's time.<br>
<br>
<u>Cheesy Factor:</u> The camera&#146;s pan is very choppy. The
1987-1990 version of this logo had a low-budget starfield that
was mostly empty. This version also had this cheesy glow effect
on the star/ball. In 1990, the logo got an update with a spiffier
starfield. However, the camera's pan remained choppy in
throughout logo&#146;s long run.<br>
<br>
<u>Music:</u> Had three sets of music, some spooky fading synth
music, a dreamy tune, and another unrelated dreamy tune.<br>
<br>
<u>Variations:</u> This logo had many different variations
throughout it's long run:</font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font
color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><strong>1987-1990:</strong> the
fading synth music, simple starfield, voiceover.<br>
<strong>1987-1990 variation 1:</strong> fading synth music, same
starfield, voiceover, sped-up<br>
<strong>1987-1990 variation 2: </strong>fading synth music, same
starfield, sped up, but there is a video freeze and
&quot;PRESENTS&quot; appears letter by letter at the bottom. This
was a bumper seen on early DIC Video releases.<br>
<strong>1987-1990 variation 3:</strong> the fading synth music,
same starfield, choir singing &#147;DIC.&#148; This variation is
extremely rare.<br>
<strong>1990-1999:</strong> the dreamy music, spiffier starfield,
new voiceover kid.<br>
<strong>1990-1999 variation 1</strong>: the dreamy music, same
starfield, voiceover, sped-up.<br>
<strong>1990-1999 variation 2</strong>: the same as above, except
there is a byline that says &#147;In Association with RETITALIA
s.p.a. and TELECINCO&#148;. This was seen around 1991-1994.<br>
<strong>1999-2001</strong>: Different dreamy tune, sped-up, the
1990 starfield, and a different kid saying the name.<br>
<strong>2003-present:</strong> Instead of the regular DIC logo,
has the &quot;Incredible World Of DiC&quot; globe zoom up outside
the window, with light rays shining behind it. When the globe
stops, the light rays flash. The logo also has a different
starfield that appears to be a cheap rotating 2D image. The music
and voiceover is the same as the 1999 version.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"><u>Availability:</u> Shows
that would sport the 1987-1990 version aren&#146;t currently
being shown on TV, but should be replaced with the Incredible
World of DiC when they&#146;re rerun in the future. The rare
variation with the choir singing &#147;DIC&#148; was occasionally
featured on post-1987 episodes of <em>The Real Ghostbusters</em>.
Some shows with the 1990-1999 version, such as <em>Captain Plane</em>t,
are now being reran on cable, though usually late at night. The
RETITALIA/TELECINCO version was seen on <em>Sonic The Hedgehog</em>,
and infamously, <em>Hammerman</em>, M.C. Hammer&#146;s 1991-1992
cartoon show. The 1999 version is not current, but it is still
prevalent on the Disney Channel, Toon Disney, and the Cartoon
Network. Also, many shows with the &#147;Kid In Bed&#148; logo
can be found on video. The new 2003 variation can be seen at the
end of 1960s <em>Speed Racer</em> reruns on the Speed Channel.<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor:</u> Nightmare for the fading synth music, High
to Median for the two dreamy music variations. The darkness of
the logo, the spiked star, and sudden appearance of
&#147;DIC&#148; weren&#146;t easy to look at either.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">3rd Logo <br>
(2001-)<br>
<br>
<u>Nickname:</u> &quot;The Incredible World of DiC&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Logo:</u> On a colorful background filled with stars and other
assorted patterns, a purple globe pops up, zooming to fill the
screen and backs up. On the upper-half of the globe, some
sparkles fly across and write the words<br>
<br>
The <br>
Incredible World<br>
of <br>

<br>
(in the same-font as the &#147;Kid in Bed&#148; logo) zooms out
to the logo; also like the previous logo, a kid is often heard
saying the company name.<br>
<br>
<u>FX:</u> Just DiC quality animation.<br>
<br>
<u>Music:</u> A light techno-pop tune with bells.<br>
<br>
<u>Availability:</u> Common, appears on the current
(good-to-mediocre) DiC-produced shows, such as Sabrina: The
Animated Series and Mary-Kate and Ashley in Action! on Toon
Disney, and a variant with no voiceover appears on Liberty&#146;s
Kids on PBS. Also plasters older DiC logos when they are rerun on
local stations (that have an Incredible World of DiC Saturday
Morning block).<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor:</u> None, the logo is mostly cute but great for
children; but it will be annoying to people who like the older
DiC logos. </font></p>
