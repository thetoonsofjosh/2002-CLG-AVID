INC.</b></font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1952-1955)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: An in-credit logo Similar to
the 20th Century Fox logo, except instead of &quot;20th Century
Fox&quot;, it reads &quot;TCF&quot;. Underneath was
&quot;Produced by TCF TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS, INC. IRVING ASHER,
Executive In Charge of Production.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Arial">(Note: An in-credit mention for
TCF in association with CBS was seen on episodes of &quot;Perry
Mason&quot;)</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: None, it's a still logo</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: The outro of whatever show it
was playing on.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Rare, seen on &quot;My
Friend Flicka&quot; in color.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1955-1961)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Starry Sky&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We see a backdrop of the night
sky covered with stars and clouds. Over this backdrop, we see the
following text fade in, not similar to any of their movie logos,
might I add</font></p>

<p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">20th <br>
CENTURY-<br>
FOX</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This company name, in bold letters, fades
in as if it were streaking from the bottom left of the screen.
The &quot;20th&quot; seems to be more to the right of the other
text, not as displayed here.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The fading in of the company
name.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None, for it was accompanied
by whatever theme song was playing throughout.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Near Extinction,
although it was last seen on &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie
Gillis&quot; on Nick At Nite/TV Land.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1961-1992)</font></p>

<p><font color="#C4A964" face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;The
Searchlights&quot;, &quot;Zoom-Out&quot;, &quot;20th Television
Fox&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#C4A964" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a dark blue
sky background, 3 rows of words, &quot;20th&quot;,
&quot;CENTURY&quot;, and &quot;FOX&quot;, apparently carved out
of stone or metal and in a gold color, are seen. The words are
&quot;stacked&quot; on top of each other, with similarly carved
lines separating the rows. After a second, the word
&quot;TELEVISION&quot;, slanted at an angle, suddenly appears,
filling the screen. It then rapidly zooms out, plastering itself
on top of the &quot;CENTURY&quot; on the stack of words. A
circular stage-like structure juts out from the base of the
&quot;stack&quot;. There are pedestals on both sides of the
stack, each with a non-moving searchlight. In the background,
several searchlights scan the sky.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">There are two main versions of
this logo: One based on the 1970s searchlight logo and one based
on the 1980s redraw.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The searchlights, the zooming
out of &quot;TELEVISION.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The
&quot;TELEVISION&quot; appearing and zooming-out really really
REALLY looks choppy and amateurish.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Three versions here, all
variations of the famous Alfred Newman jingle:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">1963-1967: A short tune that is a
        variation of the jingle but does not sound exactly like a
        Fox jingle.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1965-1988: Sped-up version of the
        above. Scariest music used on this logo.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1988-1992: Extremely short version of
        the Fox jingle.</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Fox has replaced this
with a newer logo (most likely the 20th Television one), but can
still be seen on older prints of a few shows. Several episodes on
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; DVD set still have it, and for some
reason, has been spotted on Comedy Central's print of Office
Space (a 1999 movie, so this is really messed up). A similar
situation happened on a few episodes of The Pretender when reran
on TNT.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: This actually varied a
bit, depending on the logo:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">1965-1982: High, the fast-paced jingle
        combined with the sudden zoom-out of the
        &quot;TELEVISION&quot; and scary searchlight drawing will
        cause more than a few scares.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1982-1992: Median, the sudden zoom-out
        is still there but the drawing and jingle are now tamer.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial">Both versions of these logos often
        followed those scary &quot;IN ASSOCIATION WITH&quot;
        screens.</font></p>
    </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1995-)</font></p>

<p><font color="#C4A964" face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;CGI
Searchlights&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#C4A964" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: It's exactly
the same as the current </font><a href="#20tv"><font
color="#C4A964" face="Arial">Twentieth Television</font></a><font
color="#C4A964" face="Arial"> logo, but now the stack of words
has been modified to resemble the standard Fox stack, with
&quot;TELEVISION&quot; added to the bottom and the whole thing
looking rather taller.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The logo zooming out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Two main versions:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">1996-97: The 1988 TV jingle, but
        re-arranged and re-recorded by Bruce Broughton.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1997-now: A re-recorded version of the
        1965 jingle!</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Fox network commonly uses their own
        fanfare over logos, due to generic credits-- due to the
        fact that much Fox programming is produced by Fox, these
        fanfares go well with this logo. From 1997-2001, a simple
        Fox drumroll was used; the 2001-2002 season introduced
        different &quot;remixes&quot; of the Fox fanfare, usually
        only using the final four notes.</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Typically found on
network programming provided by Fox. May or may not be present in
syndicated repeats of network programs-- the 20th TV logo may
cover it up.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None.</font></p>

Tepidity&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#C4A964" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We see a
close-up of the familiar Fox structure, but now it's in CGI and
reads &quot;20th TELEVISION&quot;, with the line below that (that
would normally be reserved for &quot;FOX&quot;) replaced by a
simple golden square. The logo zooms out to the familiar Fox logo
distance.</font></p>

&quot;A NEWS CORPORATION COMPANY&quot; began appearing below the
logo in 1993.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: The 1988 jingle was used
initially, but was re-recorded in 1995.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#C4A964" face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We see the
standard Fox structure, this time reading &quot;FOX TELEVISION
STUDIOS&quot;. However, all is not well. The normally clear sky
is gone, and a thunderstorm is brewing overhead! Worse yet, one
of the searchlights blows out during the logo! The News Corp.
byline is still intact.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C4A964" face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The stormy sky,
the searchlight going on us.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C4A964" face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: The final
four notes of the long version of the Fox fanfare.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C4A964" face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Can be
seen on most comedies that Fox produces like &quot;The
Hughleys&quot; and &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, and some
shows on Fox Sports Net.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C4A964" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None,
just a funny send-up of every single Fox logo. :)</font></p>

</b></font><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial">(2001-)</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial"><u>Logo:</u> We see the
&quot;Fox Television Studios&quot; logo described above. Suddenly
a bolt of lightning crashes down on the logo, and when the light
clears the logo has changed: the sky has cleared again, and we
see the Fox structure with a giant star on top of the stack and
the words<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#FFFF00" size="6" face="Arial"><b><u>FOXSTAR</u></b></font><font
color="#FFFF00" face="Arial"><br>
</font><font color="#FFFF00" size="2" face="Arial"><u>P R O D U C

<p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial">in the lines below.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial"><u>FX:</u> The stormy sky,
the lightning, the logo switch. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor:</u>
Nice-looking CGI for the most part as with other current Fox
logos, but the logo transition from Fox Television Studios to
Foxstar Productions is very jarring and unprofessional. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial"><u>Music:</u> Same as Fox
Television Studios.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial"><u>Availability:</u> Seen
on documentaries produced by Fox such as AMC&#146;s
&quot;Backstory&quot; and A&amp;E&#146;s &quot;Biography&quot;
(post-2001 episodes). </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor:</u>
Minimal to Median, the choppy transition between logos and the
scary &quot;star&quot; structure will probably catch more than a
few off-guard, especially if you&#146;ve never seen it before. </font></p>
