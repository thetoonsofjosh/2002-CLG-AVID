<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: In the
center of a </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#0000FF">blue</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> background is the
image of a man riding a pegasus or some winged beast. He is holding a
quill (feather). On both sides of the image are ribbons with the
company's name; "KING FEATURES" is on the left ribbon and "SYNDICATE"
is on the right. Below the eagle is a montior-shaped box that says
"TV." The word "Presents" appears under the opening logo. Then a star
spins towards the screen from the center of the logo. When it stops,
Popeye appears in it and toots his pipe, followed by the title screen
and credits. At the end, the </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">white</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> quill writes out "The
End," then flips to the right to rejoin the logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
spinning star, the quill "writing."</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Opening
- an abridged version of the generic cartoon sailor song "The
Sailor's Hornpipe" (played on what sounds like a flute), leading into
"Popeye the Sailor Man" which plays over the credits. Closing - The
end to "The Sailor's Hornpipe."</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
I'd guess rare, considering that most people say they haven't seen
the made-for-TV KFS Popeye cartoons of the 1960s.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The centerpiece may be a little intimidating if you are not sure that
it is a pegasus. The Popeye music coming out of nowhere with that
star may make some people antsy as well.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">(Mid 1960s)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nicknames</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"The Blondie Logo," "KFS Crown Logo", "Jumping Shapes"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A very
difficult logo to describe because a lot happens in a short time. We
first see a rectangle with a equilateral triangle in the center,
along with two triangles on either side with one curved side each. On
the lower left hand corner and upper right hand corner of the
rectangle, there are two dots.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The dot on the lower left drops and explodes
into 8 small dots and 5 larger dots. The triangle on the left side
drops along with the other dot. The triangle blossoms like a fan into
a flower shape, while the other two triangles drop and form an
hexagon shaped by six triangles, except the upper triangle is
missing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Then at one point, we see the four "pieces" of
the KFS logo on the screen, before they suddenly "multiply" and jump
all over the screen, finally forming the KFS crown logo, which
shrinks and moves to the upper left of the screen above the words
"KING FEATURES PRESENTS". (It is ID'ed as "A KING FEATURES
PRESENTATION" at the end of some TV shows)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
moving shapes jumping across the screen.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Opening
- The first notes sound similar to the Universal theme from the late
70's. These occur during the dropping phase. Then big band music is
heard while all of the shapes jump all over the screen and during the
formation of the KFS crown. The closing is the same as the
opening.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
This logo appeared on the animated cartoon series "The Beatles" and
"Cool McCool" on network TV. It was also seen on television prints of
Columbia Pictures' Blondie movies. However, since I have seen the
KFS-owned Blondie movies with Columbia Pictures original credits on
American Movie Classics , this logo may be vanishing. However, if
your station has been showing Blondie for a long time or if you owned
a video of the Blondie movies from KFS Home Entertainment, you may
see this logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Median to high, considering the sudden big band music sounding, and
the jumping shapes.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"Crown Trail"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
blue background, the words "King Features Entertainment" slowly zoom
out. When the words get to a median distance, a "trail" of stylized
outlined crowns come from the left and right side above the logo,
consolidating into one stylized outlined shield. The words
"Distributed By" may appear in an arc above it.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The crown
trail.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The trail looks kinda cheesy.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A weird
early 80s synthesizer theme.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
May appear at the end of some movie telecasts, but other than that,
extinct.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The music may get to some.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"Rolling Crown"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
black background, a blue 3D crown spins onto the screen. It moves
towards the top, as the black background begins to become
blue-grayish (the color moves up from the bottom). The crown, when it
gets near the top and comfortably small, flashes and becomes a 2D
stylized crown like in logo 2. Below it the words "King Features
Entertainment" appear in the same font as logo 2. The words "A
Subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation" appear below it. Sometimes,
"Distributed By" may appear above the crown.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
rolling crown.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Rather bad CGI.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
generic synth-guitar theme.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Can be seen on old videocassettes of Popeye and Krazy Kat. Can also
be seen without music on G-Force on the Cartoon Network when that
network shows it.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Low, I could see someone getting a bit spooked by that dated synth
theme, but this is pretty clean.</FONT></P>
