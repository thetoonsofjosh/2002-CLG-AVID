</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica">(1948-1982)</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>Logo</u>:
There is usually no logo shown on television; many shows simply
ended with the following words shown on the screen (usually
superimposed):</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica">A</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica">MARK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BILL</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica">GOODSON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TODMAN</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;
PRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica">On some shows,
such as &quot;The Price is Right,&quot; &quot;Match Game&quot;
and &quot;Tattletales&quot;, the words would be accompanied by
&quot;flowers&quot;; one on top and one on the bottom.&nbsp; On
&quot;Blockbusters&quot;, the words are accompanied by two
starbursts, also on top and on bottom.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>SFX</u>: None
really, it was an in-credit logo</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>Music</u>:
Usually the closing theme from whatever show that was using it,
along with an announcer who says, &quot;This is [NAME] speaking
for [SHOW], a Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Production.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>Availability</u>:
Uncommon, is still retained on many G-T shows airing on the Game
Show Network.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>Scare Factor</u>:
Low</font></p>

GOODSON PRODUCTIONS</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica">(1982-)</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>Logo</u>: In a
box-like shape are the words:</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica">A</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica">MARK</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica">GOODSON</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica">PRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica">&quot;A&quot; and
&quot;Production&quot; are along the box's border.&nbsp; Though
an in-credit logo, has had a few animated variations.&nbsp; On
&quot;Super Password&quot; it flies upwards (complete with sound
effect), it spins on the 1989 version of &quot;Now You See It,&quot;
and on the 1990-91 &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; it zooms up.&nbsp;
Also, the box is sometimes colored in, usually red or blue (as it
was on the '80s versions of&nbsp; &quot;Card Sharks&quot; and
&quot;Family Feud.&quot;)</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>SFX</u>:
Usually none, as it's an in-credit logo, but....&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>:
The animations, however, are very '80s.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>Music</u>: The
show's theme, accompanied by an announcer who says, &quot;This is
[NAME] speaking for [SHOW], a Mark Goodson Television Production.&quot;&nbsp;
In 1998, during the revival of &quot;Match Game&quot;, this
became &quot;This has been a Mark Goodson Production for....,&quot;
after which the Pearson logo would appear.&nbsp; Today, there is
no announcement when the logo appears on the current version of
&quot;Family Feud.&quot;</font><font face="Arial"> The &quot;Television&quot;
text is added to keep the length/rhythm of the phrase just like
the original.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>Availability</u>:
Can be seen on shows of the era on Game Show Network, though they
might be obscured somewhat due to split screen credits.&nbsp;
Current show-wise, you can see the logo on &quot;The Price is
Right&quot; and &quot;Family Feud.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>Scare Factor</u>:
