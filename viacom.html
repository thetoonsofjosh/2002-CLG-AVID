(1971-1976)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nicknames</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"Pinball Music", "A Viacom Presentation", "V-IA-COM"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Logo</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">: This logo had the syllables in the
word "Viacom" coming in, syllable-by-syllable, from the right, with
the background changing color. As the screen fades to purple, the V
slides in. Then the IA slides in, changing the background to green.
Then the COM slides in, changing the background to red. When the
word" VIACOM" is formed, the camera pans outward and the words "A"
and "PRESENTATION" are seen to the left and right of the word
"Viacom", over a blue</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> background. The logo
had a font similar to the one on the "Mary Tyler Moore" logo (called
"Peignot") with white lettering.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Quality Control</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: One version of the logo replaces the red background
with black. Could possibly be because of film quality, however. Other
sources would have this logo completely out of sync with the sound
effects.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor/SFX</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Animation was very rough, old keyboard music, changing
backgrounds, zoom out.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Consists of four synthesized ascending pinball-like chimes, also kind
of sounds like the sound effects you hear on some news programs. The
first three bring up the syllables to "Viacom," and the last, which
plays over the zoom-out, has a zap-like "WHOOSH" that blends in with
the last bell.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Pretty much gone, the shows have had other syndicators or have been
updated with the 2nd or other logos. However, it has turned up on at
least 5-10 color episodes of "My Three Sons" on The Hallmark Channel.
Supposedly these include episodes last seen on Nick at Nite around
1988-90.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Median, it has scared some by its cheesy animation, fast pace, "zoom
out", and primitive music. But compared to the 2nd logo, it's
nothing. </FONT></P>

(1976-1986)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nicknames</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
"Creepy V of Death", "The Purple V (Of Doom), "V of Doom," "Killer
V," etc.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a sky
blue background, the words "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#FFFFFF">A Viacom Presentation</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">"
zooms in from the center of the screen at a very fast pace. Then, a
fancy-cut, purp</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">le "V"
comes</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> from the center and moves gradually
closer and closer to the screen, with the "V" ending up taking nearly
the entire screen.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Variants</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">A network television version usually had
   the V and the name "Viacom" zooming in together, more on this
   later.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">There are videotaped and filmed versions of
   this logo. The latter usually appears on black and white programs,
   and has a film-like appearance to it</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">There is an uncommon variation that has a
   much sped up logo and music.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Urban Legend</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Rumor has it that there was a version of this logo that used the
"pinball music" from the first Viacom logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX/Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Off the charts, the logo looks like it's a purple
piece of cardboard being zoomed up, and that music, was the composer
in a hurry and in a bad mood that day?</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Had a
5-note synthesized tune with a timpani drum cresending throughout.
Even after the logo faded to black, the timpani's echo can still be
heard.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Most shows that had this ID usually have been updated with the
current Paramount ID. It might be seen on local stations that show
older Viacom shows like The Honeymooners, I Love Lucy, The Andy
Griffith Show and Gomer Pyle USMC. Also, the filmed version of the
logo is on the 1970-71 season finale of "My Three Sons" on Hallmark.
Is also seen at the end of most Cannon episodes shown on TV Land
Canada.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Nightmare, the music and "V" jarring on the screen had been a source
of bad dreams and nightmares for many. The audio quality is also
poor. One of the scariest logos ever created. </FONT></P>

"Giant Silver V", "Silver V", "Rotating Silver V", "V of
Steel"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: We start
out with a screen, divided half purple on top and half silver on the
bottom. The silver part then rotates counter-clockwise (ala CBS-FOX)
and a fancy-cut V (same design as V of Doom in 2nd logo) appears. The
word "Viacom" is seen under the V and the V shines.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
rotating V, the V "shining".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Had pin
drops with a sound similar to the opening sound on the THX sound
system ID.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Appears on Father Dowling Mysteries on PAX, but at warp speed. Also
shows up on '80s prints of other shows such as "Beverly Hillbillies"
and "We Love Lucy" on local TV.</FONT></P>

Minimal, The "THX-like" sound might have scared a few here and there,
but it's mainly harmless. </FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
shaded blue background, a silver "V" flies from the bottom left and
then backwards. As it does so, a zig-zag line comes out of it to form
the other letters in the name, with the "A" and "M" still taking the
form of zig-zags. The completed logo shines, as a voiceover says the
company name "Viacom."&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Many think the announcer is mispronouncing
   the word Viacom. It is indeed </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"

   "enterpr</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">i</FONT><FONT

   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Two alternate versions of the logo include
   a shorter version where the announcer cuts in earlier, and one
   with different music that sounds like it is played on a flute. The
   flute music was heard on syndicated prints of The Cosby
   Show</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">There is a text variation on this logo for
   Viacom Productions. It has the "Viacom" text already formed, but
   "PRODUCTIONS" zooms in from the right.</FONT>

coiled line turning in</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">to
"\/|/\CO/\/\"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
The other letters in the logo seem to fall out of the zig-zags rather
than the zig-zags just turning into them.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: In most
cases, had new age-type synthesized music. Had telephone-like sounds
when the curled-up line uncurled. Otherwise it would have the flute
tune as described above.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Can still be seen on the many shows syndicated by Viacom, but mainly
on old cable prints. This logo is being phased out with the current
Paramount ID or the current ID.</FONT></P>
