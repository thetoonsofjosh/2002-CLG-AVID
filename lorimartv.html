<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1972-1978)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;LP&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a blank </font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Arial">red</font><font face="Arial">
screen, we see the words &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF"
face="Arial">A Lorimar Production</font><font face="Arial">&quot;
(&quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Presentation</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; for movies). A thick </font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">white</font><font face="Arial"> line
starts to draw out the letter &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF"
face="Arial">L</font><font face="Arial">&quot; as the music began
to play. Then it turns and goes straight, then wraps around and
forms the letter &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">P</font><font
face="Arial">&quot;, using the bottom of the &quot;</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">L</font><font face="Arial">&quot;
above to serve as the bottom of the &quot;</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">P</font><font face="Arial">&quot;.
It then stopped at the bottom of, and between the words &quot;</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Lorimar Production</font><font
face="Arial">&quot; as the music hit its highest note. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX/Cheesy Factor</u>: Very simple,
rough, 2D animation</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: An electric piano-type scale
is played as the &quot;LP&quot; is formed... going up this scale:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Low C, A, E, F, A, Mid C, E, F, A, High C (hold
and fade, leaving an echo)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This ditty was composed by the team of Jack
Elliot and Allyn Ferguson. Most ad agencies who arranged and
composed jingles for advertisements, also wrote up little jingles
for company logos.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Was seen recently on
&quot;Apple's Way&quot; reruns on TV Land, and should be retained
on most Lorimar reruns of the era when shown. Recent Waltons
reruns shown on TNN, among others, have had either no logo or in
a case on the Family Channel, the Lorimar-Telepictures logo. So
it's a hard call.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Minimal, it's doubtful
that many were freaked out by this logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1978-January 1986)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;The </font><font
color="#FFFF00" face="Arial">Yellow</font><font face="Arial">/</font><font
color="#FF8000" face="Arial">Orange</font><font face="Arial">
Line of Doom&quot;, &quot;Script&quot;, &quot;The Line of Doom&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Had a black background, with </font><font
color="#FFFF00" face="Arial">yellowish</font><font face="Arial">-</font><font
color="#FF8000" face="Arial">orange</font><font face="Arial">
letter/logo color. This logo was run to the same music as stated
below, but the company name was totally animated out this time by
a thin line. At the end of &quot;Dallas&quot; or &quot;Knots&quot;,
the credits fade to black, a few film dust specks and as the
music starts to play, the </font><font color="#FFFF00"
face="Arial">yellow</font><font face="Arial">-</font><font
color="#FF8000" face="Arial">orange</font><font face="Arial">
line begins its trip at left center screen. Going down and
turning it forms the &quot;L&quot;, then makes a loop to form the
&quot;O&quot;, turns again and goes up, around and diagonally to
form the &quot;R&quot; and then back up to form the &quot;I&quot;.
Another section starts, goes up, diagonally down, diagonally up,
then down again to form the &quot;M&quot;, then up and down again
at angles to form the &quot;A&quot;, then finally, up, around,
and down diagonally to form the second &quot;R&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variations</u>: This logo had a couple
of variations. </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">The syndication version said &quot;Distributed
        By&quot; above </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Made-for-TV movies had &quot;Presents&quot;
        below.&nbsp;</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Superb animation/timing</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Same, but the scare factor
rose anyway</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Rare, was kept when
TNN reran &quot;Dallas&quot; a few years back, but isn't reran
anymore. Should be seen on most Lorimar shows of the era when
reran, as WB is better when preserving logos now.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: High, because this
logo was shown on a black background, the space between the end
credits and the logo morphed quite well. This gap would last a
few sections, and that creepy electric piano chord all adds up to
a very dark nature, including that perfect timing.</font> </p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Lorimar-Telepictures</B></font><br>
<font face="Arial">(January 1986-September 1989)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Early Variant</u>: L-T merged in January
of 1986, but because there was no logo made yet, both the Lorimar
and Telepictures logos played onscreen, Lorimar above, and
Telepictures below that.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;L-T&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Two comet-like streaks with a
blueish glow swerve toward each other. As the lines get closer,
the ends of each start to gain a red glow. When the lines
connect, a red fireworks-type effect flashes/explodes in the
background, and the Lorimar-Telepictures logo zooms up rapidly in
the center. This logo has both company names in their usual
fonts, in white, with a hyphen between them. When the logo has
finished zooming out, the red &quot;fireworks&quot; fade into a
black background, which yet again, starts to fade to blue.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Swerving lines, the &quot;L-T&quot;
logo popping out</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: The fanfare was arranged and
composed by &quot;X-Files&quot; composer, Mark Snow, along with
John Parker. This logo was also played with the (then) current
Rankin-Bass logo at that time for animated shows, which made it a
tad bit scary, but nothing traumatizing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music Variant</u>: Very rarely, the
original Lorimar music was played with this logo. This was
spotted on a recent rerun of Perfect Strangers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: With WB's saving of
old logos, this is becoming more common.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Pretty low, This was a
great logo.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">4th Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(September 1989-September 1991)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Marble Background&quot;,
&quot;CGI&quot;, &quot;White Marble&quot;, &quot;Marble&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We start with a white marble
background. At about the same time, wave ripples zoom out fomr
the center. This causes &quot;LORIMAR&quot; (in black, and
familiar design used in previous logos) to be written out, not
unlike the 2nd logo. At about the same time the &quot;A&quot; in
Lorimar is finished, a shadowed red bar with &quot;TELEVISION&quot;
in white, etched in, rotates in below LORIMAR.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Byline</u>: In the later days of this
logo, the text &quot;A Time Warner (Entertainment) Company&quot;
is seen below, right after the bar zooms out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The CGI bar rotation, ripple,
pretty neat stuff</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A relaxing synth driven track
with a horn that plays a few notes.&nbsp; There's also some type
of wind FX behind the music. &nbsp;</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Uncommon, can still be
seen on re-issues of Lorimar shows from the era</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None whatsoever. An
excellent logo. A favorite among myself and the CLG members.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">5th Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(September 1991-September 1994)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We go back to the </font><font
color="#FFFF00" face="Arial">yellow</font><font face="Arial">-</font><font
color="#FF8000" face="Arial">orange</font><font face="Arial">
&quot;LORIMAR&quot; logo for this, but with the word &quot;Television&quot;
below and no animation whatsoever. Seen onscreen with the credits.
&quot;A Time Warner Company&quot; is seen below everything else.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None really, seen on end
credits</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None. The show's end theme
played as an announcer said &quot;(Show title) is a (show creator...usually
Miller-Boyett Prod) in association with Lorimar Television&quot;
(in syndication, the WB Distribution logo followed with the
announcer mentioning that as well)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: On this logo can get
cut off after the &quot;Miller Boyett&quot; line often, meaning
they skip to the &quot;WB Distribution&quot; logo. Full House
reruns are pretty decent at keeping this logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None. Unless you play
the second logo's animation in your head.&nbsp; </font><font
size="4" face="Arial">:P</font></p>
