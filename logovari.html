    <li><font face="Arial">The Mouse That Roared (1959): The
        statue leaves her pedestial leaving her torch behind. In
        the end credits, you can see her rushing up the stairs of
        the pedestial grabbing her torch again. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Bye Bye Birdie (1963): The Columbia
        torch lady's flame leaps from the torch to form the title
        of the film. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Strait-Jacket (1964): At the end of
        this horror film starring Joan Crawford, the decapitated
        torch lady appears with her head on the ground. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Cat Ballou (1965): The Columbia Statue
        transforms into an animated version of Jane Fonda as a
        cowgirl who is holding two guns and firing them. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">A Man Called Flintstone (1966): The
        torch lady is replaced with Wilma Flintstone, dressed as
        the Torch Lady! Unfortunately, Great American edited out
        this variation when they owned Hanna-Barbera. Shame. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Thank God It's Friday (1978): We see
        the Torch Lady posed as in the start of &quot;The
        Sunburst/Abstract Torch&quot; logo. Suddenly disco music
        starts playing and the Lady turns animated and gets into
        a few seconds of dancing. Then she resumes in Torch pose
        and the rest of the logo plays as normal. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">What Planet Are You From? (1999):
        Annette Bening's head is pasted onto where the Torch
        Lady's head is as an inside joke (as some people have
        said the 90s TL looks like her) </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Ali (2001) The logo rolls backwards.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Charlie's Angels (2001): After the
        normal sequence of the displaying of the Columbia logo,
        the camera zooms toward the right side of the logo, until
        the clouds fill up the entire screen, and the opening
        credits start from there. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Men in Black II (2002) In the
        theatrical trailer, the Columbia Pictures woman wears the
        trademark MIB sunglasses. At the beginning of the movie,
        the torch in the hand of the Columbia Pictures logo
        flashes (like a neuralizer).</font></li>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">The Robe (1953): That was the first
        CinemaScope movie. It had a new revamped 20th Century-Fox
        logo at the beginning. There was no fanfare and instead
        of the dark evening sky, there was a huge red curtain
        behind the logo. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1957)
        At the very start, Tony Randall appears onscreen before
        the 20th Century Fox logo, with musical instruments, and
        plays part of the fanfare himself. He then complains
        about &quot;the fine print&quot; in his contract, before
        introducing the cast and the movie. As he introduces the
        film, he forgets the title, first calling it _The Girl
        Can't Help It_ (q.v.). Then he rummages through his
        pockets for his notes and comes up with a girl's name and
        phone number. Finally, his three female co-stars appear
        to announce the film's correct title.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Silent Movie (1976): This Mel Brooks
        film has the logo about a minute into the movie after the
        three main characters take the pregnant woman in the car
        with them; the camera pans, and a 20th Century Fox
        billboard is seen; the O seems to be coming out at the
        audience, and from it comes a red screen and the credits
        begin. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">That's Hollywood (1976, TV): Normal
        Fox TV (1966) logo, but the fanfare is reorchestrated. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The World's Greatest Lover (1977):
        Normal Fox (70s) logo, but the fanfare is a &quot;comic&quot;
        version. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Cannonball Run (1981): Had cars
        driving all around the 20th Century Fox logo. Sadly, this
        logo is usually edited out of television airings. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Edward Scissorhands (1990): Snow is
        falling on the (80s) logo.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">White Men Can't Jump (1992): Normal
        Fox (80s) logo, but the fanfare is a &quot;funk/rap&quot;
        version. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">X-Men (2000): The X in the Fox logo
        stays on the screen for a split-second after the logo
        fades out. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Moulin Rouge (2001): Footage of the
        Fox logo plays onscreen in a concert hall behind draped
        red curtains, and the symphony playing the fanfare can be
        seen below the stage. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Planet of the Apes (2001) The
        background fades to a starfield, before the logo itself
        fades out and the camera pans to the planet below.</font></li>

    <li><font face="Arial">An unknown Marx Brothers Short: We
        don't know the title at this point, but it starts with
        the 30s MGM logo-the lion roars once and fades into
        Groucho who roars into the camera. The last one is Harpo
        who also tries to roar but no sound is heard. He then
        grabs a horn and does some honking sounds with it. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Petunia National Park (1939): The MGM
        logo contains an ANIMATED Leo the Lion! </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Blitz Wolf (1942): We see the red/yellow
        sunburst MGM Cartoon logo, with Leo the Lion roaring in
        delayed motion as synched to jazzy opening music. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Batty Baseball (1944): The main
        credits (including the MGM lion) don't appear until a
        character asks to see them.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">North by Northwest (1959): The MGM
        logo is seen in monochrome over a light cyan background. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Tom and Jerry theatrical features
        during the Chuck Jones era (1960s): The MGM lion
        transforms into Tom who meows and hisses. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">A Gene Deitch Tom and Jerry short (1960):
        The ending of this cartoon has Jerry climbing into a
        mousehole decked out with an MGM ribbon. His face gets a
        bit more vicious as he roars with the MGM lion roar sound!
        </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">MGM's The Big Parade of Comedy (1964,
        B/W): We see the MGM logo with the sign &quot;Out to
        Lunch&quot; over the circle, hiding Leo's head as he
        roars. Suddenly the sign flips up to reveal an animated
        man trapped in Leo's mouth kicking, beating, and yelling
        &quot;Ow! Ow! Get me outta here!&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Dance Of The Vampires/Fearless Vampire
        Killers, The (1967): In the opening credits the MGM-lion
        transforms into a vampire. [This leads into the animated
        prologue MGM added (along with 35 minutes of cuts) prior
        to its release over director Roman Polanski's objections.
        Polanski deleted this from the 1990s director's cut
        version. Dont worry-the original's still in print.]</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">2001: A Space Odyssey (1968): Instead
        of the normal lion, there is an outline of a lion in a
        white circle on a blue background. MGM is below it, and
        the lion was used as the symbol for MGM's record label
        way back.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Night of Dark Shadows (1971): When the
        MGM lion roars at the beginning of this film, no sound
        comes out. The 90s home video release has the normal
        version instead.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981): The lion's
        roar is replaced with Tarzan's yell. It was originally
        replaced wih the regular version on TV, but current
        Turner/Warner Bros. prints retain this variant.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Strange Brew (1983): Standard MGM
        opening, but the lion, instead of roaring, belches and
        appears disinterested. The camera then pulls back from
        the logo and pans towards the Great White North set. A
        few minutes later, the lion roars in the background, and
        Bob or Doug comments, &quot;Oh, NOW he roars...&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The Lionhearts (1998): A lame animated
        sitcom featuring the MGM lion and his family. No, we're
        not making this up! Anyway, the animated version of the
        lion seen in this show has a turn in the ribboning. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Josie and the Pussycats (2001): The
        MGM lion morphs into a screaming fan.</font></li>

    <li><font face="Arial">Alpine For You (Popeye Short, 1951):
        An end gag that may have started it all. Bluto's on this
        mountain top and then Popeye grabs the mountain top with
        Bluto on it with a lasso. He then punches Bluto and lets
        go of the mountain top and stars emerge from Bluto's head
        and form the Paramount logo, as the words &quot;A
        Paramount Picture&quot; appear below Bluto. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The Bad News Bears Go to Japan (1978):
        We see the normal Paramount logo changing into the blue
        Mountain logo.Nothing unusual so far but then the Blue
        Mountain silhouette transforms into the Fujiyama vulcan
        silhouette.The logo looks quite funny with that flat top
        mountain. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Indiana Jones Series(1982, 1984, 1989):
        These logos were replicas of the classic &quot;A
        Paramount Picture&quot; logo but with Gulf + Western info
        added at the bottom. The mountain fades from the logo,
        and are: a real mountain in South America (Raiders), a
        mountain drawing on a gong (Temple of Doom), and a
        mountain in the southwest United States (Last Crusade). </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Big Top Pee Wee (1988): The 50s era
        &quot;A Paramount Picture&quot; logo is seen, without a
        byline. There is a special, magestic fanfare included as
        well.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Coming To America (1988): The CGI
        Paramountain forms as usual (with a Gulf + Western byline).
        It then turns into a real mountain (with stars and text
        intact), and we zoom in over the top, and past the
        letters. Quite neat. This is done as Eddie Murphy's
        character lived in the Kingdom beyond the Paramountain. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Hard Rain (1998): The Paramount
        mountain is seen in much worse weather than normal; the
        camera pans down from the logo to scenes of flooding.</font></li>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">The Birds (1963): A rare variation of
        the Universal globe superimposed into the picture itself.
        Was also used at Hitchcock's &quot;Marnie&quot;. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The Sting (1973): The Universal 1930s
        &quot;Art Deco Globe&quot; is seen tinted in brown. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Smokey &amp; The Bandit II (1980): An
        animated car chase around the Universal Globe is seen. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Xanadu (1980): The 1920s Universal
        globe with biplane flying around opens the film. As the
        opening credits appear, the globe remains on screen and a
        succession of increasingly modern flying machines (four-engine
        airliner, Concorde, flying saucer) emerge from behind the
        Earth. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">ET (1982): The Universal logo
        animation is played backward, so we go from the world out
        to outer space. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The Burbs (1989): We see the normal
        Universal Globe (looks computerized tho) but then the
        text fades out leaving only the globe and then we zoom
        into the globe- closer and closer until we fly over the
        town as the start credits roll. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Mo' Better Blues (1990): Flavor Flav
        of the rap group Public Enemy spells out the letters in
        &quot;Universal&quot; (then says &quot;You've been
        rollin' for 75 years!&quot; and yells &quot;Yo,Spike!
        Start the movie,man!&quot;) as the 75th Anniversary logo
        appears on the screen.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Street Fighter (1994): The logo forms
        as normal. However, after a few seconds, the text fades
        out, leaving only the globe. The globe shakes and the
        &quot;Street Fighter&quot; logo forms around it! </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The Flintstones (1994): Variation on
        the 1990 Universal logo, the logo reads &quot;UniverSHELL&quot;
        and script is carved in stone. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Casper (1995): The globe turns into
        the moon. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Waterworld (1995): The Universal 90-97
        globe stays visible after the text fades out, and we zoom
        into the globe as the globe is covered with water. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas (2000):
        Similar to the above, only the variation is on the 1997
        Universal logo instead. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Gladiator (2000): A color-change job,
        this time the Dreamworks and Universal logos are golden-toned.
        </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Meet the Parents (2000): During the
        opening logos, the singers in the theme music are
        lyrically commenting on the &quot;glowing earth&quot; in
        the Universal bumper and the &quot;boy in the moon&quot;
        in the Dreamworks bumper.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Jurassic Park III (2001) During the
        studio introduction, each logo (Amblin as well) is
        accompanied by the 'ripple-in-the-water' effect and the
        sound of a heavy footstep.</font></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">Warner Brothers </font></p>

<hr>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">In Our Time (1944): After the WB logo
        appears at the end, the letters W and B are seperated and
        letters added to form the words &quot;BUY War Bonds&quot;.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Lumberjack Rabbit (1954, Looney Tunes):
        The shield shoots up towards us like normal... but
        overshoots its mark so that it looks like it's crashing
        into the screen! It then moves back to its normal
        position though. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Bugs Bunny/Roadrunner Hour (1970s):
        Instead of the normal \\' logo used at the time, we get
        treated to Bugs and the Roadrunner standing beside a
        bannerless WB shield! &quot;WARNER BROS. TELEVISION&quot;
        and &quot;A WARNER COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY&quot; are above
        and below it in the fonts used on the \\' logo. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Blazing Saddles (1974): On a plain
        blue BG, we see the late 40s-early 50s shield, with the
        1936 Max Steiner WB fanfare playing. Suddenly, a blazing
        fire breaks out and spreads around the logo and across
        the screen, flaming away the logo and transitioning to
        the movie opening credits. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie (1979):
        The &quot;That's All Folks&quot; card keeps appearing at
        the beginning and end. In the beginning, after they show
        the Warner Communications logo, they show the traditional
        &quot;That's All Folks&quot; card that is usually shown
        at the end. Bugs Bunny appears in front of it and sniffs
        and gets rid of the background and sniffs again then he
        pushes the words &quot;That's&quot; and &quot;All Folks&quot;
        separately and down comes the word &quot;NOT&quot; in red
        capital letters underlined. Then it reads, &quot;That's
        NOT All Folks!&quot; Then Bugs pulls the traditional
        opening Warner Bros. logo shown at the beginning.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">One Crazy Summer (1985): The logo
        appears as normal. Then, suddenly, it turns into a
        crudely drawn version of the shield, with wiggling clouds.
        The Warner Communications byline and clouds dissipate as
        a REALLY-EVIL looking bunny opens the WB shield from
        inside. He laughs evilly, and then we zoom into his
        mouth, seeing the &quot;ONE CRAZY SUMMER&quot; title zoom
        up on us. Scary as hell. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Sesame Street's Follow That Bird! (1985):
        This is an oddity, as it is contained within the movie
        itself, actually (Oscar does a Patton-like speech at the
        beginning), and features no banner or Warner
        Communications byline! It consists of Big Bird blowing up
        a WB shield balloon, with a voiceover: &quot;This movie
        is brought to you by the letters W and B!&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990):
        Instead of the normal shield logo, a replica of the
        classic 1943-1963 WB &quot;circles&quot; cartoon logo
        comes up, with its text and minus shield (&quot;PICTURES,
        INC.&quot; is removed in favor of &quot;A TIME WARNER
        COMPANY&quot;). The shield then zooms up with Bugs Bunny
        riding it, and the text fades out. Daffy Duck then comes
        onscreen, angrily, pushes him off the shield (&quot;50
        years of you hogging the spotlight is ENOUGH!&quot;), and
        tries to ride it... well, it doesn't work as good for him
        :) They also have another Looney Tunes-style ending, with
        Porky doing the usual &quot;That's All Folks!&quot;
        ending before Daffy, like before, complains of Porky
        hogging (no pun intended) the spotlight, saying something
        to the effect of &quot;60 Years of you doing the end
        title is enough&quot;. Daffy trys to say the end line,
        but like before, is stopped by Porky, who finishes the
        line.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers (1991):
        OPEN: A recreation of &quot;The Bullseye&quot; logo with
        orange circles, black center and &quot;Bugs Riding The
        Shield.&quot; Animation and music is similar to the 1940s
        Looney Tunes bumper, but the title of the logo reads
        &quot;WARNER BROS. ANIMATION INC.,&quot; and the &quot;LOONEY
        TUNES&quot; title card reads below &quot;A WARNER BROS.
        CARTOON MADE IN N.Y.C. AND BURBANK.&quot; <br>
        CLOSE: We see a recreation of the 1944 Porky In The Drum
        logo, in which a badly animated &quot;stereotype&quot;
        version of Porky bursts out of the drum and tries to say
        his famous line in a pale voice imitation as outer-spacey
        sound-effects play in the background. A frowning Bugs
        enters from the left and kicks the fake Porky out, then
        grabs the real Porky and puts him in the drum where he
        belongs. Porky is surprised for a moment &quot;Oh, oops&quot;
        then proceeds with his famous line and pose as Bugs
        exhaustedly exits right.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Batman Forever (1995): The WB shield
        transforms into the Batman logo. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">From Hare To Eternity (1996): The 1992
        Warner Bros. Family Entertainment logo is seen as normal,
        but we do not hear &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; as
        often plays over the logo, INSTEAD we hear a
        reorchestration of the 1936 Max Steiner WB fanfare. Other
        variations are done on &quot;The Bullseye&quot; opening/closing
        credits: the open on this cartoon has a Chuck Jones
        byline, and the close has &quot;That's All Folks!&quot;
        written over the bullseye in a SMALLER script than usual.

        transforms into a frozen Batman logo. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Conspiracy Theory (1997): The initial

        applied so they look &quot;computerish&quot;. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Wakko's Wish (1999, WB Family
        Entertainment): The standard &quot;Bugs walks out from
        behind the shield, does a Vanna pose, and chews his
        carrot&quot; logo... until Wakko from Animaniacs walks
        out, does a Vanna pose... and takes a huge bite of the
        shield! Bugs is not amused. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Space Cowboys (2000): The Warner Bros.
        and Village Roadshow logos aren't animated. Also, they

        color scheme as the first five minutes of the movie.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Swordfish (2001): The opening studio
        logos for Warner Bros and Village Roadshow Productions

    <li><font face="Arial">Toy Story (1995): In the DVD version,
        when the THX logo appears it gets burned out like a

        and the THX sound resumes and the robot goes back inside
        it.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Recess (2001, Disney): T.J., Spinelli,

    <li><font face="Arial">Lilo &amp; Stitch (2002, Disney) At

    <li><font face="Arial">The Amazingly True Story of the Texas
        Cheerleader Murdering Mom (1992?, HBO): The standard HBO
        Picture logo plays, but with a female voiceover: &quot;Next
        on HBO, -it's The Amazingly True Story of the Texas
        Cheerleader Murdering Mom!&quot; She then pauses and then
        incredulously says: &quot;That's REALLY the title?&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Psycho (1998, Imagine) The logo drips
        in blood instead of water.</font></li>

        throw in a &quot;Willlbur! I'm Flyyying!&quot; response
        in there. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">A Bridge Too Far (1977, United Artists):
        It begins with the words &quot;United Artists&quot; over
        a plain black background, zooming out as the Hexagon
        border fades in layer-by-layer. Then the grainy
        background fades in with the Transamerica logo and byline
        below the Hexagon logo. </font></li>
