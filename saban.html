with a ring. In the middle of the planet and the ring, the word
"SABAN" is seen in a very weird font. Below it is the word
"PRODUCTIONS". On the bottom half of the planet to the left, there
are five lines.</FONT></P>

Rare, as it was only seen on "I'm Telling!", "Kidd Video", and

background with stars, a </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#A5B8A8">silver</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> rectangle with a
circle-shaped hole in the middle moves slowly from the left-hand side
of the screen towards the middle of the screen, growing as it does
so. In the hole, "glowing" but in black lettering is the word "SABAN"
and below the circle-shaped hole is the word "ENTERTAINMENT". On the
right side of the screen, a </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#C9A22C">gold</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> "plate" twirls towards
the middle of the screen as well. As the plate gets closer to the
rectangle and the middle of the screen, it starts twirling faster and
faster until it is affixed firmly in the hole in the center of the
rectangle. Three white lines are seen on the bottom-left of the
circle.</FONT></P>

synthesized theme ending in what sounds like a jail door slamming
shut. For most of the 90s shows, the end of the show's theme played
on it.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Rare, can be seen on pre-96 episodes of Power Rangers (specifically
Mighty Morphin') when they're rerun on ABC Family.</FONT></P>

Low, the "jail door slamming shut" may unnerve some people but the
logo is otherwise tame.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: "The
Saban Twirly-Doo"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A group
of kids, ethnically diverse and wearing extremely weird clothing,
take a piece of cloth with a globe pattern imprinted on it and then
run to opposite ends of a small "orb". They then raise their hands up
as they fade out and the orb "transforms" into the Saban logo, which
resembles a </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#C9A22C">gold</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> crescent moon on the
right with 3 "swishing" lines on the left. The word "SABAN" is below
the logo. This is done on a cloud background that seems to "shoot"
from the center.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Variants</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
There are 3 variations on this logo. </FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">A "short" version that only has the
   "hands-up" part of the animation.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">A "medium" version that has all of the
   parts described above.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">A "long" version that starts off with a
   close-up shot of the kids and then goes into the animation
   described above.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Nothing
cheesy, professional graphics used here.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
flute-like jingle that eventually coalesces into a trumpet.</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music Trivia</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
This music was actually used on a Saban show, "Masked Rider" (made
before the "twirly-doo" was introduced), as the theme for one of the
supporting cast members, the alien Ferbus.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Still preserved on pre-2002 episodes of Power Rangers and Digimon, as
well on most series from Saban's library, including some of the 1980s
Marvel Productions shows it owns ("Dungeons and Dragons"). However,
the company itself does not exist anymore, having been acquired by
Disney and dissolved into the Disney corporate structure. Current
episodes of Power Rangers and Digimon have no logo and a copyright
credit to "BVS Entertainment", with BVS standing for Buena Vista
Studios.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Low, the music and the kids may catch someone off-guard (and as one
Power Ranger fan noted, he screamed when this logo was first used on
that show), but it quickly becomes simply annoying (as it is the
Columbia TriStar of the kids' TV logo business).</FONT></P>
