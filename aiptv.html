<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo <br>
(ca. 1960-1966)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;AIP Car Plate&quot;
, &quot;AIP Skyline&quot;, &quot;Sixties Capital Building I&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a skyline background, we
see the American International Pictures logo of the era (the
words AMERICAN and INTERNATIONAL side by side a drawing of the
Capital Building in a &quot;Raceway&quot;-like font), except that
the word &quot;TELEVISION&quot; is in place of
&quot;PICTURES&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None, this was a still logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availiability</u>: Scarce. This was on
early syndicated rerun prints of &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie
and Harriet&quot; (before Ozzie Nelson took over distribution in
the late 1960s) and English-dubbed episodes of the Japanese
cartoon series &quot;Prince Planet&quot;. It can still be found
on old prints of the Mexican &quot;Samson&quot; (El Santo) films
dubbed into English by K. Gordon Murray. An in-credit version
still exists on the first two seasons (1964-66) of the cartoon
series &quot;The Adventures of Sinbad Jr.&quot; produced by
animator Sam Singer. The AIP films now have their original logos
at the beginning preceeded by the Orion logo or the MGM Lion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None, this AIP logo
looks kinda cool really. It resembles a car nameplate from the
era more than it does a film/TV production company's logo.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo<br>
(1966-69)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Sixties Capital
Building II&quot; , &quot;AIP Button&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We see on a dark BG, an image
of the Capital Building inside a two-layer circle, resembling a
coat button, with the words &quot;American International
Television&quot; appearing below the Capital Dome. [This was a
modified version of the late-1950s AIP logo.]</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None-this was a still image.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Extinct. Appeared on
some syndicated programs including early AIP films. [The late
Samuel Arkoff retained ownership of the earliest AIP films and
licensed them to Teleworld, so this no longer appears on TV.]</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo<br>
(1969-1973?)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;The Capital
Dome/Creepy AI Combo&quot;, &quot;Creepy AI I&quot;, &quot;The
Avengers Logo&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Over a black background, we
see a color-changing circle with a line drawing of the Capital
Building inside. Then, it zooms into place as part of the
American International Pictures logo, which is now an abstract
lettering design consisting of the initials AI, to the right of
the screen. After the circle moves into place, the bottom segment
of the &quot;A&quot; and then the &quot;I&quot; fade into place
forming the complete logo. The phrase &quot;American
International Television Presents&quot; then fades in below the
logo after it forms. This was a modified version of the American
International Pictures logo of the era (1969-73).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Colors changing, the circle
zooming to the right and the rest of the logo forming.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A loud, battling horn, flute
and drum/tympani fanfare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Extinct; appeared on
the original US syndication prints of &quot;The Avengers&quot;
and TV prints of AIP films. &quot;The Avengers&quot; is now owned
by Canal+, so outside tapes (of certain episodes of that series
from early 1990s A&amp;E reruns) this is long gone. Expect the
Orion (or MGM) logo to preceed the AIP logo on feature films. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Median. Some people
might be put off by the logo and its fanfare.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">4th Logo <br>
(1974-80)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>:
&quot;AiTV&quot;,&quot;The OTHER Creepy ai&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a blue background, we see 4
white angular letters spelling &quot;AiTV&quot; popping onto the
screen one by one; the last two overlapping the letters
&quot;Ai&quot; on top. Then the phrase &quot;American
International Television, Inc. presents&quot; pop in near the
&quot;Ai&quot; section of the logo,which then changes color to
red. The complete logo fades out about a second before the empty
screen fades to black.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Closing Version</u>: A still shot of the
complete logo, with a yellow background, a brown logo and
lettering (this time reading &quot;Distributed By American
International Television,Inc.&quot;); this is silent, with the
theme playing out over it on some shows.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The lettering and words popping
into place,changing color as the sequence plays out</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: An ascending horn and string
fanfare; rather sedate compared with its predecessor</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Extremely Rare;
appeared on Lorne Greene's New Wilderness, Star Maidens, Twiggy's
Jukebox and TV syndication prints of AIP films. In use until
AIP's 1979 merger with Filmways. American International TV was
absorbed into Filmways in 1980, becoming Filmways Television.
Lorne Greene's New Wilderness remained avaliable to TV stations
from Orion Television until the mid-1980s with the AiTV logo
still present. Outside of tapes (or any future MGM Worldwide
Television reissues), the latter AITV logo is gone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Minimal. Although a
minor eyesore, it's fairly harmless.</font></p>
