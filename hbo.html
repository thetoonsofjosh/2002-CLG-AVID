<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
black background is a row of what looks like five rainbow doors, each
one positioned at an angle. Above the doors are the words
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">IN ASSOCIATION
WITH</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">" and on them, "</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">HBO</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> (in the
familiar logo) </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">DOWNTOWN
PRODUCTIONS</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">." All the words are in
white.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Later Variation</FONT></U><FONT

rendering of the doors, which close shut in this variant. Also, only
the words HBO Downtown Productions remain.</FONT></P>

in Space"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: We start
with a somewhat busy city intersection (horns honking, etc.) at
twilight. The music starts, and the camera "flies" forward down the
street, eventually panning up to reveal the source of the light -- a
star (positioned near the top center of the screen) that gets
brighter and brighter, and eventually explodes, leaving behind a
shiny silver CGI monolith. The monolith moves down and across the
screen and rotates clockwise, revealing itself as the HBO logo, then
turns around one more time as the camera zooms in on the side of the
O. The side of the O disappears in a flash of light, revealing a
stream of colored rays streaking counter-clockwise around a silver
axis, and one of: * "HBO FEATURE PRESENTATION" * "HBO FAMILY
SHOWCASE" (the music would get softer and play an uplifting theme
just after the O disappears in this case; I also think the animation
was slightly different, but I don't remember the difference) * "HBO
SPECIAL PRESENTATION" appears, one word atop the other, in a heavy,
3D steely-gray font. The words then disappeared and the animation
would fade to black with more flashes from the surrounding
rays.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Variations</FONT></U><FONT
FACE="Arial">:</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">A short version of the logo that starts
   before the "big bang" is shown most often.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Three different endings depending on what
   the special is. They include "HBO Saturday Night Movie", "HBO
   Special" and "On Location"</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Different music at the end of this, mostly
   a happy tune for family-friendly programs.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Updated version is in the works, start date
   unknown.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The city
cars, wind, and the light sounds in the end. The CGI used for the HBO
logo is very hi-tech (for the time)</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A
dramatic theme (that in the long version, starts with a whoosh and a
piano/string chord and gets progressively more tense) leading into a
very loud, upbeat, almost disco-style horn-driven overture, then
ending with synth sweeps (representing the rays "inside" the O).
Composed by Ferdinand J. Smith, who was also responsible for the ABC
Star Tunnel's score (not Frank Gari, as the SuperSite posits), and
co-wrote the CBS "Projector" ident's score.</FONT></P>
