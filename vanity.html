<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Arsenio Hall Communications</B></font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1989-1994)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Woof Woof&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background (with
purple stripe), the words &quot;ARSENIO HALL&quot; are in large
capital letters, with &quot;COMMUNICATIONS&quot; in a smaller
white font on the bottom of the screen. The word &quot;HALL&quot;
takes up most of the screen, and it is in dark blue, while &quot;ARSENIO&quot;
(in light blue) is much smaller, and it is near the top of the
screen. The words &quot;ARSENIO HALL&quot; have an orange line
under them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None, this is a still logo</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Two arrangements of the
&quot;Arsenio Hall Show&quot; theme music. The first one
featuring the outro of the theme. The second one was the first
four bars of the jazzy tune (composed by Hall himself), followed
by Arsenio Hall shouting heavily &quot;Woof Woof,&quot; (dog bark
åla the infamous &quot;Dog Pound&quot; section of his studio
audience, which cheered to Arsenio's signature expression while
swinging their fists in the air). Though the theme music's
arrangement changed with the show's opening titles, this ID
remained the same throughout the run.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Sound Variant</u>: On the short-lived
1991 music program &quot;The Party Machine with Nia Peebles&quot;
the sounder had Nia going &quot;Arf! Arf!&quot; in place of
Arsenio.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Rare. Originally seen
on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; and &quot;The Party Machine&quot;.
&quot;Arsenio Jams&quot; (edited versions of &quot;The Arsenio
Hall Show&quot; that aired in 2001 on VH1) kept this logo intact.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low; Arsenio's &quot;barking&quot;
can catch somebody off-guard, but is generally considered to be a
humorous logo.</font> </p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Bedford Falls Company</B></font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1987-1995)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background is a
black-and-white sketch of a 19th century 2-story house connected
on the left to a black filmstrip with a white shadow. It is
snowing outside. The text &quot;A BEDFORD FALLS COMPANY&quot;
fades in below. A light goes on in the top left window of the
house. The text &quot;in association with&quot; fades in at the
bottom of the logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Background</u>: As you may have guessed,
this logo is basically a homage to &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;
(1947). Bedford Falls was the name of the town in this movie, and
there is a scene where stones are thrown at a house that looks
similar to the logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u></font>: The snow falling, the
text fading in.</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The house looks like
an undetailed, tacky etching, the snow looks fake, and what is
the filmstrip with the shadow supposed to represent?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A man-and-woman singing
together: &quot;...and, dance by the light of the moon.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Seen on episodes of
&quot;thirtysomething&quot; whenever anyone decides to show them,
followed by the MGM/UA Television Productions logo. &quot;My So-Called
Life&quot; was another show featuring this logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, the darkness and
the &quot;in association with&quot; fading in may scare some.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>BRANIFF</B></font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1997-)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;Believe It!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: We see a live action airplane,
slowly glazing through the clouds, in sunrise. The plane is seen
from the front and the &quot;camera&quot; is zoomed in close. The
plane has an orange trim to it. Once the plane is about midpoint
from zooming, the Braniff logo slides in from the left, toward
the bottom, acting like a person inside a car being subject to an
abrupt brake and then accelerating back (you know what I mean).
The </font><font color="#FF8040" face="Arial">Braniff</font><font
face="Arial"> logo has abstract lettering with an orange fill to
it. The text &quot;</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Believe
It!</font><font face="Arial">&quot; appears below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Background</u>: This logo was actually a
commercial for the now-defunct Braniff Airlines. It was seen
circa late 70s. The music was pasted on the ID.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Hard to determine, as I can't
really determine how this commercial was originally made.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u></font>: <font
face="Arial">The &quot;abrupt stop&quot; effect for letters, the
flying plane looks quite fake, grainy film</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: An uplifting electric piano
theme that fits the high &quot;spirit&quot; of the logo. The
South Park closing theme plays over often, especially in later
seasons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Seen on South Park on
Comedy Central</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, the music and
change of film quality may startle some.</font></p>

in from the left on the bottom. Each word is in capital lettering
and in a &quot;typewriter&quot; font. Each word has the same size
except for &quot;Productions&quot; which is considerably smaller.
The logo appears similar to this when complete:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Only the end of the Cheers

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Still saved on all
episodes of Cheers, currently seen in both syndication and Nick
At Nite.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Minimal, the silence
and sliding words might cause a shock.&nbsp; </font></p>

color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">white</font><font face="Arial">)
background, the company name is in a typewriter font.&nbsp; Below
is an essay in a very small font which must be paused on tape to
read it.&nbsp; Episodes of &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; have a

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: None.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: An opera-like high note is
sung throughout the logo in the beginning of Dharma's run, but
now usually has generic network music over. With the show now
canceled and about to enter syndication, it is unknown at this
point what music will be used.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Can be seen on &quot;Dharma
&amp; Greg&quot; in syndication.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None, you'll just be
mad by how you can't read a word. Also, if you saw the logo on a
black background combined with the music, like the &quot;In
Association With&quot; screens, you won't like that either.</font>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>David E. Kelley Productions</B></font><br>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Old Woman,&quot;
&quot;I've Fallen and I Can't Get Up,&quot; &quot;You Stinkah!&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: An old woman is watching TV
and a burst of wind comes into the room. She yells &quot;You
stinkah!&quot; as &quot;David E. Kelley Productions (in
association with...)&quot; appears in a typewriter-like font and
she falls backward. At the end, her feet are sticking out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There are some new variants that were added
in a 'rotation' in 2002. More on those later.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The wind sounds and the TV
screen popping.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Usually contains the
onomatopoeia mentioned above. However on &quot;The Practice&quot;
the sound effects are mixed together with the ABC-TV jingle (starting
with the fall '98 season). For &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, the
musical backdrop is a snippet of the show's theme, &quot;Searching
My Soul,&quot; followed by simply a Fox drumroll. The person
yelling &quot;You stinkah!&quot; in the logo is David E. Kelley's
late grandmother.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: To find it, just watch
&quot;The Practice,&quot; &quot;Boston Public,&quot; or &quot;Ally
McBeal.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, although I assume
some people may be freaked out by the old woman tumbling from the
chair.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a yellow productions we see
&quot;FOUR PRODUCTIONS, INC.&quot; in the claredon condensed font
colored black, followed by the appearance of three D logos, from
smallest to largest. The D's form in the center in between the
FOUR and PRODUCTIONS. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Sequencing</u>: The original ABC network
run of &quot;Barney Miller&quot; featured this logo by itself.
The syndicated run beginning in 1979 featured the short version
of the Columbia Pictures Television starburst at the end (Most
common), and later said to have featured the Columbia TV 1980's
Torch Lady, and now features the 1993-2001 Columbia-Tristar Boxes
of Boredom.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The appearance of the D's</font></p>

<p><u>Cheesy Factor</u><font face="Arial">: Limited animation-all
the D&#146;s do is just appear! How cool is that?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A simple piano tune, with
chimes ringing in the appearance of the Ds, followed by one more
chime to close the logo out. An electronic organ arrangement,
with a drumbeat instead of a third chime was used from January-September
1975, with a piano arrangement used from September 1975 to the
end of the show's run in September 1982. This logo was composed
by Jack Elliott and Allyn Ferguson, who composed the theme for
Barney Miller and also composed the Lorimar Television 1972-86
Jingle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Seen at the end of
Barney Miller, on TV Land, and ONLY seen on Barney Miller. Danny
Arnold always created a new production company for every series
he created.</font></p>

        in C-Sharp Major, is played in C-Sharp Minor.</font> </li>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The shusshie's hand moving, the
lights being turned off for the Gracie logo to be projected.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: After the &quot;shhhhh&quot;,
a somber, yet jazzy electric piano tune plays, is said to be the
chorus to the 80s pop song &quot;The King of Wishful Thinking&quot;,
by Go West.</font></p>

on the left side of the rectangle. The rectangle has a black

a baby laughing. The cow then rolls its eyes in disgust.</font></p>

more stylelized and became animated. The Mohawk text became a bit
more cursive, and is over a box, half black, half white. The
text, &quot;Productions Inc., In Association With&quot; is below.
This whole logo comes in from the right (ala Paramount Blue
Mountain). The animation/ultrasound is about the same, except it
has a blue tint to it this time, instead of black/white like
before.</p>

<p><u>SFX</u>: The actual ultrasound</p>

<p><u>Music</u>: A drumbeat, followed by a baby's giggle. Due to

on ABC &amp; Syndication and &quot;Norm,&quot; if that show ever

passed by and gives an unconvincing &quot;Grr, Argh&quot;. The

<p>There were several variations and some history behind this
