<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Background</u>: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial">Embassy was founded by film
        producer Joseph E. Levine in the late 1940s. Levine
        distributed among others </font><font size="3"><em>Godzilla,
        King of the Monsters</em></font><font size="3"
        face="Arial">, </font><font size="3"><em>Hercules</em></font><font
        size="3" face="Arial"> (the 1955 Steve Reeves version)
        and most infamously, </font><font size="3"><em>Santa
        Claus Conquers the Martians</em></font><font size="3"
        face="Arial">. [There was no logo in the pre-Avco years,
        ,just a &quot;Joseph E. Levine Presents&quot; blurb at
        the beginning and &quot;An Embassy Pictures Release&quot;
        blurb at the end of a film, both in the style of the
        credits.]</font> </li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial">He sold the company to Avco,
        an aviation equipment and financial services company, in
        1967. The familiar AE logo wasn't used for movies until
        about 1969 though the TV unit adopted the logo upon
        Avco's buyout of the film distributor.</font> </li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial">After Avco Embassy's sale to
        Norman Lear, Lord Lew Grade (who had just stepped down as
        head of ITC) was brought in to run the Embassy Pictures
        International unit-that lasted until Embassy was sold to
        Coca-Cola (which absorbed the division into Columbia
        Pictures).</font> </li>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;AE&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Three copies of a stylized
&quot;AE&quot; (consisting of a right triangle, a rectangle, and
three striped horizontal vertical lines) float in a circular
pattern. The logos are red, green, and blue, and they eventually
merge to form a white version of the logo. This one changes
colors one shape at a time; the triangle turns blue, and each of
the other shapes turn green. Below, three copies of the message
&quot;AN AVCO EMBASSY FILM&quot; (red, green, and blue) come in
from the left, right, and bottom and merge under the logo to form
a white version of the words.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>TV Version</u>: For television, the text
reads, &quot;AN AVCO-EMBASSY TELEVISION PRESENTATION&quot;</font><font

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: The &quot;merging,&quot; similar

<font face="Arial">1st Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1982-1983)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: When Embassy
started/relaunched in 1982, they did not yet have a logo.
Instead, this text was used:</font><br>
<font face="Arial">AN</font><br>
<font face="Arial">EMBASSY TELEVISION</font><br>
<font face="Arial">PRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Later that year, their corporate logo was
unveiled-- a boldface &quot;E&quot; extended to feature a star
cut-out. The same text as above was used, but &quot;EMBASSY&quot;
was changed to boldface and &quot;TELEVISION&quot; was moved
below that line of text. These words were positioned to the right
of the &quot;E&quot; logo, and &quot;AN&quot; and
&quot;PRODUCTION&quot; is featured above and below the logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u>: None, it's a still in-credit
logo</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: The outro of the show</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: It's on the end
credits of &quot;Square Pegs&quot; and 1982-83 season episodes of
&quot;Facts of Life&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;One
Day at a Time&quot; and &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;. Being an
in-credit logo, it is usually left alone. The all-text version
can be seen on the pilot episode of &quot;Square Pegs&quot;.</font></p>

&quot;Spinning E,&quot; &quot;Rolling *E&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Then in 1983, Embassy had an actual logo
separated from the credits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Over a blue background, we see
2 white parts of the Embassy logo (an E with a star cut-out on
the right). The 2 parts zoom out and spin counterclockwise until
they match up in the center of the screen. Under it would read
one of the following (as they appeared on screen):</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">EMBASSY TELEVISION (network shows,
        1983-1986)</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">EMBASSY</font><br>
        <font face="Arial">TELECOMMUNICATIONS (syndicated
        programs, 1983-1986)</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">EMBASSY</font><br>
        <font face="Arial">COMMUNICATIONS<br>
        a unit of the Coca-Cola Company (network and syndication,
        1986-1988)</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">All text is centered in the
&quot;Coca-Cola&quot; version</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In 1988, Coca-Cola created &quot;Columbia
Pictures Entertainment,&quot; merging all their TV production
banners together. Embassy shows were now produced by ELP
Communications.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Movin' On Up</u></font><font size="1"
face="Arial">: </font><font face="Arial">On later-season episodes
of The Jeffersons, the logo was added onto the show but in an
interesting way. Instead of doing a straight fade/cut to the
logo, the end credits faded to a shot of skyscrapers. Over this
image, the &quot;E&quot; star logo appeared (and the music
started), rolling in over this background. The background soon
faded to blue, and &quot;EMBASSY TELEVISION&quot; appeared like
normal over this image. This logo variation has been praised by
those who've seen it as very professional and very cool; however,
the sudden appearance of the logo and music are sure to scare a
few people. Surprisingly, this version is/was in pretty good
circulation-- out of 6 late season episodes aired on Nick At
Nite, 4 of them have this logo. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>FX</u></font>: The rolling E, text
fading in</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The &quot;Rolling
E&quot; is 2D, and doesn't really have any inspiring animation,
and the music is totally 80s, with that cheap synthesizer tune.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: A high-pitched, 8-note,
synthesized tune, the 7th note is rolled noticeably.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Extremely rare, but
has been spotted on two episodes of The Facts of Life on Nick at
Nite; episode titles: &quot;For the Asking (1982)&quot; and
&quot;The Beginning of the End (1988),&quot; maybe one or two
Jeffersons episodes from the 1982-1983 season, and a few Silver
Spoons episodes, however, Nick At Nite currently does not
currently rerun any of these shows. Expect the Boxes of Boredom
to replace this late, lamented logo. It was recently found on
reruns of &quot;Who's the Boss?&quot; on Prime Network in Canada.
A 1982 episode of The Facts of Life reran on the Hallmark Channel
recently with the Coca-Cola version shown.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: Median, it's a pretty
fast-paced logo, that won't give the viewer much warning to it's
appearance. The dated, loud music can add to that surprise factor
as well. I gasp whenever it is shown by mistake on Facts Of Life
reruns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In 1982, when Lear acquired Avco Embassy,
the motion picture division changed accordingly, becoming
&quot;Embassy Pictures&quot;. In 1986, when Coca-Cola bought
Embassy, Lear kept control of the motion picture division and
retained the company name.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: Same as </font><font

<font face="Arial">1) The logo is on a brighter blue background</font><br>
<font face="Arial">2) The animation is much slower and smoother</font><br>
<font face="Arial">3) &quot;EMBASSY PICTURES&quot;, of course, is
underneath, but it fades in instead of simply appears</font><br>
<font face="Arial">4) No music</font><br>
<font face="Arial">On some releases, the logo will appear without
the &quot;EMBASSY PICTURES&quot; text. This is mainly for later
releases when the company was called &quot;Embassy Film
Associates&quot;.</font></p>

<p>To sum it up, here is what has became of all the Embassy
properties:</p>

<p>In 1985/86, Embassy was broken up into three parts and sold to
various different corporations.<br>
<br>
Coca-Cola/Columbia kept the Embassy Television division, merging
it with Columbia Pictures Television to form Columbia/Embassy
Television. This company name was never used on-air, but trade
ads in Broadcasting and Cable magazine show a hybrid version of
the Coca-Cola Telecommuniocations logo, with the print version of
the 80s Torch Lady in the upper half, above the coke
&quot;swoosh&quot;, and Embassy's logo below the coke
&quot;swoosh&quot;. Embassy was retired for good when Tristar
Television was merged with Columbia/Embassy to form the new
Columbia Pictures Television.<br>
<br>
Embassy Pictures wound up with Dino De Laurentiis, who renamed it
De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, or DEG for short. DEG was
never a big success, but it did introduce two memorable logos; a
&quot;flipping lion&quot;, and then the masterful &quot;stone
lion&quot;. That company inherited the Embassy and Avco/Embassy
library, which shifted around when DEG went under. The library
now resides with Canal +.<br>
<br>
The Home Video division went to Nelson Entertainment, which began
marketing Embassy's videos under that name. (Nelson retired the
Charter Entertainment label, which Embassy also distributed stuff
under.) Nelson retained home video rights to Embassy's pictures
and began entering the production business themselves, most
notably the Bill and Ted movies, and teaming with Rob Reiner's
Castle Rock Entertainment and Columbia Pictures for &quot;When
Harry Met Sally&quot;. Nelson, too, went under, eventually ending
up at MGM. MGM retained the rights to Nelson's movies and some
Embassy films, such as &quot;The Howling&quot;, &quot;Escape from
New York&quot;, and &quot;This is Spinal Tap.&quot; The rest of
the library reverted back to Canal +, which licensed the films to
Anchor Bay for distribution.</p>
