<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">New Line was started in 1967; however, they
did not use a logo until 1983.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">1st Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1983-1987)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nickname</u>: &quot;The (Creepy) Red
Line&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a black background, a red
line stretches out across the screen. It then &quot;flashes&quot;
many times, seeming to vibrate and form more lines above. The
lines eventually form the words &quot;NEW LINE CINEMA&quot;, and
when the word is completed the screen begins to flash red. When
the flashing is finished, the logo is now red with black
segmenting (think the CBS/Fox logo), and the word &quot;FROM&quot;
can be seen above and to the left of the logo. The logo is &quot;wiped&quot;
away at the end.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Print Logo</u>: New Line used a
different logo in print and at the end of trailers and movies--
it is the letters &quot;NL&quot; connected together. As far as we
know, this was never used as an actual New Line logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The &quot;flashing&quot;, the
line effects</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: The logo looks butt
ugly, first off. Secondly, the vibration and flashing effects are
not well done.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: None, and this increases this
logo's scare factor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Can be seen on the
first two Nightmare on Elm Street movies and the Critters movies,
as well as a few more, maybe... anything more?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: High, the ugliness of
the logo and the black and blood red color scheme is hard to
swallow.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">2nd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1987-1995)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Box and Filmstrips
I&quot;, &quot;The Ladder&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: On a blue/white ethereal
background, a black box zooms and twirls from the screen. In the
background, several filmstrips float by, as the box is joined by
two filmstrips. One of the filmstrips attaches itself to the side
of the box, and the other filmstrip tilts to a 45 degree angle
and attaches itself to the top right of the box. The background
fades to black, with the box/ladder &quot;glowing&quot; blue at
the end. The words &quot;NEW LINE CINEMA&quot; fade under the
logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variation</u>: In 1989 or 1990, New Line
established its own video label, New Line Home Video, which
distributed its offerings through RCA/Columbia Pictures Home
Video, and later Columbia TriStar Home Video. The logo is exactly
the same as the movie version, but &quot;NEW LINE HOME VIDEO&quot;
fades in under the ladder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The spinning box and filmstrip
animation, excellent 2D animation</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: No music, though it has been
rumored that logo 3's music has been used on the Home Video logo
late in its life...</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Still saved on most
1987-1995 New Line releases, but it isn't as widely seen as its
successor. Some of these titles include the Nightmare on Elm
Street films (3rd installment on), and the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles flicks. :)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None, this is a
harmless logo.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">3rd Logo</font><br>
<font face="Arial">(1995-)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Box and Filmstrips
II&quot;, &quot;The Ladder&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Logo</u>: A black box rotates out from
an extreme close-up, with a blue light in the background. Various
filmstrips zooms past the box as two more filmstrips rotate in,
one attaching itself to the side of the box, and one attaching
itself to the top-right to form the familiar logo. The blue light
dies down to create a glowing effect around the &quot;ladder&quot;
as &quot;NEW LINE CINEMA&quot; zooms out from below. The byline
fades in underneath.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Variations</u>: Several variations on
this logo:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">1995: Videotaped version of the logo,
        but a chyroned in &quot;A TURNER Company&quot; byline.</font>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1995-1997: Byline is &quot;A Turner
        Company&quot;</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">1997-2001: Byline is &quot;A Time
        Warner Company&quot;</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">2001-present: Byline is &quot;An AOL
        Time Warner Company&quot;</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Also, New Line Home Video adapted this logo
for their logo. The logo is the same, but the animation is
smoother than the movie logo (some people prefer this to the
movie logo as a result), and the music is always used. Turner and
(AOL) Time Warner bylines were used, and a new version was
sighted on &quot;The Cell&quot; with &quot;A TIME WARNER COMPANY&quot;
in a different font.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Well done CGI animation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Music</u>: Composed by Michael Kamen, a
scale performed with a flute or woodwind instrument followed by a
quiet horn tune at the end. Shortened on some movies. Very
understated and popular fanfare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Availability</u>: Much more prolific
than their past logos, given their higher-profile status thanks
to the Turner and Time Warner acquisitions. A Turner logo is a
hard find, but not too hard-- Turner-era New Line Home Video
releases can still be found on the markets if you look hard
enough. On newer issues of Turner-era releases, the Turner byline
has been replaced with a Time Warner byline, but it's nothing
major.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Scare Factor</u>: None, this is a very
popular logo.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">FineLine Features</font><font
face="Arial"><br>
(1990s-)<br>
<br>
<u>Logo</u>: Over a black background, a thin, glowing horizontal
blue line fades in, dividing the screen in half. Then, a
horizontal white line draws itself inside. The entire line
rotates clockwise and shirnks a bit in the process. When the line
becomes vertical, it rotates again, revealing an abstract F (it
really looks like a corner) with a steelish tint. Then, from
behind, a rectangel moves clockwise, and moves itself to the top
of this &quot;F&quot; shape. It forms an angle, much like a
director's block. Around the same time, a blue sportlight/circle
backdrop forms behind this shape. The following text fades in:<br>
<br>
FINELINE FEATURES (Both F's and L look slightly bigger, and the
line is sandwitched between 2 horizontal lines.)<br>
A division of New Line Cinema<br>
<br>
The tops of both shapes shine afterwards.<br>
<br>
<u>Variations</u>: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">Around 1997, the byline changed to
        &quot;A Time Warner Company&quot;. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Also, during 2000, its 10th
        anniversary year, the words &quot;10TH ANNIVERSARY: 1990-2000&quot;
        spin around the logo, coming to a stop in an arc around
        the logo.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: Very nice effects, similar to
it's parent's logo, but also reminicent of United Artist's &quot;Turning
UA&quot; logo.<br>
<br>
<u>Music</u>: None<br>
<br>
<u>Availability</u>: TBA<br>
<br>
<u>Scare Factor</u>: Low, it may look a little dark, but
shouldn't scare many.</font></p>
