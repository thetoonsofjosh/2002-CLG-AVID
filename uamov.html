The words "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">A Transamerica

the final three were a brass trio.</FONT></P>

Transamerica T"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: It
starts with two sets of blue lines going into place, one by one. One
line turns to the left, another turns to the right, and so on. There
are six lines altogether, revealing the logo of Transamerica
Corporation, United Artists' former owner. The stylized blue
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0099FF">T</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
design zooms out to the right side to make room for the company name
"</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">United
Artists</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">", which appears in a futuristic
white font. A small byline pops in afterward, inscribed
"</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Entertainment from
Transamerica Corporation</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">" and appears
under the UA name.</FONT></P>

majestic fanfare going up the musical scale, followed by a stinger of
horns and drums.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Generally replaced with a later logo, because of the Transamerica
logo and information on the logo (which is, of course, outdated).
This is presumably done because Transamerica still exists as a
company. However, the Transamerica T logo, especially the second
variation, DOES pop up from time to time on cable and Pay TV
broadcasts of Lorimar-produced films that UA distributed.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Low, even with the theme, it doesn't seem harmful. </FONT></P>

the words "</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">United

a black background. A few seconds later, the blue </FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial" COLOR="#3366FF">T</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> design fades
in on the left side of the company name. Like the previous logo
variant, the </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0066FF">T</FONT><FONT

of each other on both sides. At the same time, blue text that says
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#3366FF">A Transamerica

"Turning UA," "The Sad/Happy Music"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: It
starts with a whitish line against a black screen. The line then
reveals itself to be a silvery stylized "UA" as it turns around. The
logo is in the shape of a "U" with a bigger left side, and a diagonal
line protruding from the shorter right side to form the "A." When the
symbol finishes turning around, the words "United Artists" appear
under it in a font similar to that used in the "Transamerica"
logo.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: "Turning
UA"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: When
the logo turns around, there is a slow, somewhat somber five-note
piano tune. Then when it is totally revealed and the words "United
Artists" appears, an uplifting orchestra piece is played.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Was prolific on video and cable during the 1980s, but it's scarce
now, as its primary use was to update the older logos. Most 1980s UA
releases were released with the MGM/UA lion logo (which still
survives on video prints). However, it can still be found on some 90s
MGM/UA Home Video releases such as the early 1990s MGM/UA release of
"The Secret of NIMH".</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Scare Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
This logo could give some people the creeps, considering its dark and
ominous nature. Also, the surprising orchestra at the end might catch
some off guard. Still, this logo is also a favorite of many.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Nickname</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: "UA
Swoosh"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: Over a
black BG, we see a giant pattern of blue crystallized "UAs", styled
like the previous logo. The pattern smoothly merges together to form
one minimum-sized UA as it zooms out. A streak of light glides by to
slash the A, consisted of spikes going across. When it gets to a
certain distance, "United Artists" is seen underneath.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Variant</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: In
its early years, the MGM/UA Communications logo preceded this logo.
In its later years, the logo would be by itself, starting from the
point where the UA logo has already merged from the giant pattern,
and the phrase "An MGM/UA Communications Company" appears
underneath.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">SFX</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The
merging and zooming out of the logo and the slashing of the A.</FONT>
</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Cheesy Factor</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Median; the merging, zooming-out, and slashing looks kinda
cheesy.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Music</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: A low
bass sound, followed by a "swoosh"</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Availability</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Still common on some broadcasts of UA-produced movies, and can be
seen on UA-produced movies of the period. This logo was often paired
off with the popular MGM/UA Communications logo, and both logos are
thus regarded as favorites. The MGM-UA Communications/UA Swoosh
Mixture is still seen on current VHS and DVD prints of several James
Bond movies and movies from the Pink Panther series.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: It

is a dark-colored marble wall. The glittering stars glide over the
screen to reveal the company name, then one big star shines against
the U.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Byline</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: The

years. It was later referred to as "United Artists, An MGM Company"
starting in 1997.</FONT></P>

The current logo, or at least the most recent, as the UA website
features a new variation of Logo 4, while this still appears on video

video, while used on EVERY UA release on cable.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Logo</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: On a
black screen, white streaks appear, streaking to form a new UA logo,
that looks similar to the 1987-94 logo, except the logo is a little
narrower and there are no streaks. The words UNITED ARTISTS come from
both sides of the lower part of the screen and converge. The words
"AN MGM COMPANY" soon fade in afterwards.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Variant</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: This

Can be seen on new United Artists movies (UA is now an art-house
movie studio for MGM). This logo has also been seen on the ABC-TV
airings of James Bond Movies since January 2002. As new prints of
older movies are made, this logo will replace the older logos.</FONT>
