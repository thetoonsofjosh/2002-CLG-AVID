the center of the screen to the right. It opens and the pages
turn as a gold sun rises from behind the center of the book.
Several pages from each side of the book rise with the pie-shaped
sun and render as two gold triangles on each side. A square with
rounded corners zooms out and plasters itself around the logo. A
gold ray of light wipes the gold text &quot;GOLDEN&quot; under
the logo. &quot;GOLDEN&quot; shrinks and zooms to the left as the
ray of light wipes the text &quot;BOOK&quot; next to it and the
text &quot;VIDEO,&quot; about 3 times the size of the other text,
zooms out with a shadow trail and plasters itself underneath the
logo. The logo &quot;shines.&quot;</font></p>

around 45 degrees near the edge of the screen. As the lines begin
to finish drawing, the parts of a stylized house begin to slide
onto the screen at the area where the lines suddenly slope. The
rainbow and the house zoom out as the rainbow begins to retract.
The sloped section disappears completely, and a diagonal beam of
light draws a sharp black outline around the house and the
rainbow. The word &quot;RANDOM HOUSE&quot; fades in underneath
the rainbow/house combo, and the words &quot;HOME VIDEO&quot;
zoom in from the center.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>SFX</u>: The rainbow effects, the
sliding houses, the formation of the company name.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Cheesy Factor</u>: ...Where do I start...?
First, the rainbow lines are cheaply done. They're not even of
the same width! Second, the sliding on of the house like
construction paper blows. Third, the zooming out of &quot;HOME
VIDEO&quot; brings back bad memories of the &quot;A Viacom
